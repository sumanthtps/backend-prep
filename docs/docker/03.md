# Commands

Here's an in-depth explanation of the Docker CLI, creating containers, and
working with Dockerfiles, along with examples and questions at the end.

---

### **Exploring the Docker CLI**

The **Docker CLI (Command Line Interface)** is the most common way to interact
with Docker. It allows us to create, manage, and inspect containers and images.

#### **Basic Docker CLI Commands**

Docker commands follow this structure:

```sh
docker [COMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

##### **Getting Help in Docker**

To see a list of top-level Docker commands:

```sh
docker --help
```

Each Docker command supports `--help`, which provides information on how to use
it. For example:

```sh
docker network --help
```

This will show subcommands like `connect`, `create`, and `disconnect`.

#### **Command Flags**

Flags are options that modify command behavior. For example:

```sh
docker run --rm ubuntu
```

- `--rm` ensures the container is removed after it stops.

---

### **Creating a Docker Container**

A **container** is a running instance of a **Docker image**.

#### **Long Way to Create a Container**

1. **Create a container (without running it)**

   ```sh
   docker container create hello-world:linux
   ```

   This fetches the `hello-world` image (if not already present) and creates a
   container.

2. **Check the created container**

   ```sh
   docker ps --all
   ```

   This lists all containers (running and stopped).

3. **Start the container**

   ```sh
   docker container start <container_id>
   ```

   Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID from `docker ps --all`.

4. **View logs**

   ```sh
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

   This displays container output.

5. **Attach to a running container**
   ```sh
   docker container attach <container_id>
   ```
   This streams the container's output to your terminal.

#### **Short Way to Create a Container**

Instead of manually creating and starting a container, we can use:

```sh
docker run hello-world:linux
```

This is equivalent to:

```sh
docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
```

---

### **Creating a Container from a Dockerfile**

A **Dockerfile** is a script that defines how to build an image.

Example **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
# Use an existing base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set the maintainer
LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"

# Create a non-root user
RUN useradd -m myuser

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files into the image
COPY entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh

# Give execute permission to the script
RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh

# Define the default command
CMD ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]
```

#### **Building the Image**

```sh
docker build -t my-custom-image .
```

- `-t my-custom-image` gives the image a name.
- `.` specifies the context (current directory).

#### **Running the Container**

```sh
docker run my-custom-image
```

This starts a container from our custom image.

### **Quiz**

1. What does `docker ps` do by default?
2. How do you start a stopped container?
3. What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker container create`?
4. What does `CMD` do in a Dockerfile?
5. How can you view logs of a stopped container?

---

### **Answers**

1. `docker ps` shows only running containers.
2. `docker start <container_id>`.
3. `docker run` creates, starts, and attaches, while `docker container create`
   only creates.
4. `CMD` defines the default command for a container.
5. `docker logs <container_id>`.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts covered in your transcript:

---

## **1. Building Custom Docker Images**

- Instead of using prebuilt images from Docker Hub, you can create your own
  Docker images for custom applications.
- A **Dockerfile** defines how to build an image.
- Example files used: `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.bash`.
- Key **Dockerfile** instructions:
  - **FROM** → Specifies the base image.
  - **LABEL** → Adds metadata.
  - **USER** → Defines which user runs commands (security best practice).
  - **COPY** → Copies files into the container.
  - **RUN** → Runs commands inside the container.

---

## **2. Building a Docker Image**

- Use `docker build` to create an image.
- `docker build -t my-image .`:
  - **`-t` (tag)** → Assigns a human-friendly name.
  - **`.` (context)** → Defines which directory Docker will use.
- Docker processes **each line** in the Dockerfile as a new **layer**.
- Final image is a **squashed combination** of all layers.

---

## **3. Running a Docker Container**

- `docker run my-image` starts a container.
- If the container is **interactive**, it stays open until manually stopped.
- If the container is **non-interactive**, it runs and exits immediately.

---

## **4. Stopping & Removing Containers**

- `docker ps -a` lists all containers.
- `docker stop <container_id>` stops a running container **gracefully**.
- `docker stop -t 0 <container_id>` forcefully stops it **immediately**.
- `docker rm <container_id>` removes stopped containers.

---

## **5. Running Persistent Servers**

- Example: A container running a server does **not exit** like simple scripts.
- `docker run -d my-server` runs a server in the background.
- `docker logs my-server` shows the logs.

---

## **6. Binding Ports for Network Access**

- `docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-server`
  - `8080` → Port on the **host machine**.
  - `80` → Port inside the **container**.
- Allows access to a containerized web server from outside.

---

## **7. Managing Container Data (Volumes)**

- Data inside a container is **deleted when the container is removed**.
- Solution: Use **volumes**.
- Example:
  ```bash
  docker run -v /host/folder:/container/folder my-container
  ```
  - **`/host/folder`** → Local directory.
  - **`/container/folder`** → Mapped directory inside the container.

---

## **Building a Docker Image from a Dockerfile**

When working with Docker, you can create your own images instead of relying on
publicly available ones. This is useful for packaging and deploying your own
applications.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Dockerfile** – A script that contains instructions to create an image.
2. **FROM** – Specifies the base image.
3. **LABEL** – Adds metadata like the maintainer.
4. **USER** – Sets the user that executes commands in the container.
5. **COPY** – Copies files from the local machine to the container.
6. **RUN** – Executes commands inside the image.

### **Example Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Use an official Ubuntu as a parent image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set the maintainer
LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"

# Set a less privileged user
USER nobody

# Copy a script to the container
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/

# Make the script executable
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh

# Define the entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
```

### **Building and Running a Container**

- Build an image:
  ```sh
  docker build -t my-custom-image .
  ```
- Run a container:
  ```sh
  docker run my-custom-image
  ```

---

## **Building and Running a Docker Image**

After creating a `Dockerfile`, the next step is to turn it into an image and
start a container.

### **Steps:**

1. **Use `docker build`**

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-image .
   ```

   - `-t my-image`: Tags the image with a name.
   - `.`: Specifies the current directory as the build context.

2. **Run the Container**
   ```sh
   docker run my-image
   ```
   - This starts the container and executes the default command.

---

## **Understanding Docker Containers**

- A container is an instance of a Docker image.
- Containers can run in the foreground or background.
- A running container has a unique ID.

### **Checking Running Containers**

```sh
docker ps
```

- Shows all running containers.

```sh
docker ps -a
```

- Shows all containers, even stopped ones.

---

## **Stopping and Removing Containers**

Docker does not remove containers automatically. This can lead to many unused
containers taking up space.

### **Stopping a Running Container**

```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```

or

```sh
docker stop <container_name>
```

### **Force Stopping a Container**

If a container is unresponsive, use:

```sh
docker stop -t 0 <container_id>
```

- This immediately stops the container.

### **Removing a Container**

```sh
docker rm <container_id>
```

- Deletes the container.

```sh
docker rm -f <container_id>
```

- Force removes a running container.

---

## **Port Binding in Docker**

By default, Docker containers do not expose ports to the host machine.

### **Mapping Ports**

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

- `-d`: Runs in the background.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps **port 80 in the container** to **port 8080 on the host**.

### **Checking Logs**

```sh
docker logs <container_name>
```

- Shows output from a running container.

---

## **Saving Data with Docker Volumes**

By default, any data created in a container is lost when the container stops.

### **Example: Data Loss Without Volumes**

```sh
docker run --rm ubuntu bash -c "echo 'Hello' > /tmp/file && cat /tmp/file"
```

- Runs an Ubuntu container.
- Creates a file inside the container.
- Prints the file content.
- Removes the container, **losing the file**.

### **Using a Volume to Persist Data**

```sh
docker run -v ~/mydata:/data ubuntu
```

- `~/mydata`: Local folder.
- `/data`: Folder inside the container.

---

## **Docker Hub and Image Registry**

Docker Hub is the default registry for storing and sharing images.

### **Logging in to Docker Hub**

```sh
docker login
```

- Enter your Docker Hub credentials.

### **Tagging an Image**

```sh
docker tag my-image myusername/my-image:1.0
```

- Names the image using `<username>/<image-name>:<version>`.

### **Pushing an Image to Docker Hub**

```sh
docker push myusername/my-image:1.0
```

- Uploads the image to Docker Hub.

### **Pulling an Image**

```sh
docker pull myusername/my-image:1.0
```

- Downloads the image from Docker Hub.

### **Deleting an Image**

Docker Hub does not provide a CLI command for deletion. You must delete images
from the website.

---

## **NGINX Challenge**

**Goal:** Serve a website using an NGINX container.

### **Steps:**

1. **Use the NGINX Image**

   ```sh
   docker run --rm --name website -v "$(pwd)/website:/usr/share/nginx/html" -p 8080:80 nginx
   ```

   - `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when stopped.
   - `--name website`: Names the container.
   - `-v "$(pwd)/website:/usr/share/nginx/html"`: Maps the `website` folder to
     NGINX's root directory.
   - `-p 8080:80`: Exposes the website on port 8080.

2. **Access the Website**

   - Open **http://localhost:8080** in a browser.

3. **Confirm the Container is Gone**
   ```sh
   docker ps -a
   ```
   - No output means the container was removed.

# Docker Quiz Answers

## Question 1

**Problem:** You have upgraded your application to a new version, `1.0.1`, and
created an image for it called `my-app`. You successfully pushed the image with
`docker push`. However, after logging into Docker Hub, you notice that `1.0.1`
is not there, but `1.0.0` is.

**Most Likely Cause:**

- You ran `docker push $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:1.0.0` and forgot to run
  `docker push $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:1.0.1`.

---

## Question 2

**Problem:** You have upgraded your application to a new version, `1.0.1`, and
created an image for it called `my-app`. Which of these commands should you run
to make it easy for others to find on Docker Hub?

**Correct Commands:**

- `docker tag my-app $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:latest`
- `docker tag my-app $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:v1.0.1`

---

## Question 3

**Least True Statement:**

- "Anyone can push to Docker Hub. You do not need to register an account."
  (Incorrect)

---

## Question 4

**Why mount a directory to a container?**

- **Correct:** "Because containers do not save data after they are deleted."

---

## Question 5

**Problem:** You installed Docker and tried running a CLI command but received
an error:

```
docker [COMMAND]" requires at least 1 argument.
See 'docker [COMMAND] --help'.
```

**Most Likely Cause:**

- You forgot to provide additional options or arguments to the command. Run
  `--help` to see what is missing.

---

- `docker container create`
- `docker container start`
- `docker container attach`

---

## Question 7

**True Statement about `docker container start`**

- "You can run `docker container start` against a container multiple times."

---

## Question 8

**Problem:** A colleague created a Docker container from the `nginx` image, but
it does not show up in `docker ps`.

**Most Likely Cause & Solution:**

- They created the container with `docker container create` but forgot to start
  it. Run `docker container start` to fix.

---

## Question 9

**Problem:** Jenkins pipeline error:

```
Unable to find image 'my-app:7.2.1' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: manifest for my-app:7.2.1 not found.
```

**Most Likely Cause:**

- Docker was not able to find a container image named `my-app:7.2.1` in Docker
  Hub or the private registry.

---

## Question 10

**What does `docker exec -i -t 2bf bash` do?**

- "This starts an interactive Bash shell within a container starting with ID
  `2bf` with a pseudo-TTY allocated to it."

- "You ran `docker run` without providing the `--interactive` option and cannot
  stop the web server hosting your web app."

---

## Question 13

**Why bind a port on your computer to a container?**

- "When your container is running a network service that you want to use from
  your computer."

---

## Question 14

**Problem:** You try to remove 20 stopped containers with:

```
docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm
```

But you receive an error:

```
Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container.

**Most Efficient Fix:**

- `docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm -f`

### Optional ignore

Question 1 of 14 You have upgraded your application to a new version, 1.0.1, and
created an image for it called my-app. You successfully pushed the image with
docker push. Upon logging into Docker Hub, you notice that 1.0.1 is not there
but 1.0.0 is. What is the most likely cause for this happening?

You were temporarily offline while pushing 1.0.1 to Docker Hub.

Docker Hub only allows you to store one tag per image at a time. You ran docker
push $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:1.0.0 and forgot to run docker push
$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:1.0.1.

Correct

Question 2 of 14 You have upgraded your application to a new version, 1.0.1, and
created an image for it called my-app. Which of these commands should you run to
make it easy for others to find on the Docker Hub?

docker tag my-app $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:latest docker tag my-app
$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/my-app:v1.0.1

Correct

docker tag my-app my-app:latest

docker tag my-app my-app:v1.0.1 Question 3 of 14 Select the least true statement
from the list.

Docker Hub is the default container registry used by the Docker client.

By default, Docker images will receive a latest version tag if a version tag is
not provided. Anyone can push to Docker Hub. You do not need to register an
account.

Correct

Anyone can pull from the Docker Hub without an account. Question 4 of 14 Why
would you want to mount a directory to your container? Because containers do not
save data after they are deleted.

Correct

So that your container can access the Internet using the host's network sockets.

To improve disk IO performance.

So that the container can create directories. Question 5 of 14 You have just
installed Docker to begin moving an application that your team supports into
containers. You tried running a CLI command but were shown text similar to the
below:

docker [COMMAND]" requires at least 1 argument. See 'docker [COMMAND] --help'.

Usage: docker [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARG...]

What is the most likely cause for this happening? You forgot to provide
additional options or arguments to the command. Run --help to find out what you
missed.

Correct

That's right! Commands that require extra options or arguments will show you an
abbreviated help page when they are missing. Run --help to see what you missed.

You forgot to provide a subcommand. Run --help to see what you missed.

Incorrect

Very good guess. While this might be a cause for this text to appear, since
Docker commands are not guaranteed to have subcommands, it is not the most
likely cause. --help will show you whether the command requires subcommands or
not.

The CLI is not configured properly. Edit /etc/docker/docker.json to fix.

The CLI command is missing a plugin. Visit docker.com to learn how to install
it. Question 6 of 14 Which of these three commands is docker run a combination
of?

- docker container create
- docker container start
- docker container inspect

- docker container create
- docker container start
- docker ps
- docker container create
- docker container start
- docker container attach

Correct

- docker container create
- docker ps
- docker container attach Question 7 of 14 Which of these statements about
  docker container start is true?

You must run docker rm before running docker container start. You can run docker
container start against a container multiple times.

Correct

You can only run docker container start against a container once. To re-run,
delete the container first. You must run docker run before running docker
container start.

Incorrect

Question 8 of 14 You are helping a colleague learn Docker. They said that they
created a Docker container from the nginx Docker image, but it does not show up
after running docker ps. They confirmed that they could successfully pull the
nginx image from Docker Hub. What is the most likely cause and solution for this
problem? They created the container with docker container create but forgot to
start it. Run docker container start to fix.

Correct

That's right. docker container create creates containers but does not start
them. You will need to use docker container start to execute the image's
entrypoint.

The entrypoint for the nginx image they pulled is incorrect. Use dfimage to
recreate and save its Dockerfile, change the entrypoint, and build a new image
locally.

They need to run docker pull to pull the nginx image first before running docker
container create.

They provided the wrong image to docker container create. Fix the image, then
try again. Question 9 of 14 You are debugging a broken Jenkins pipeline that
deploys your application into production. It creates Docker containers during
the testing stage of the pipeline.

You see this error message in the logs for the last build:

$: docker run --rm my-app:v7.2.1 Unable to find image 'my-app:7.2.1' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: manifest for my-app:7.2.1 not found:
manifest unknown: manifest unknown. See 'docker run --help'.

What is the most likely cause for this error?

The Jenkins runner node does not have enough disk space to pull new Docker
images. Docker was not able to find a container image named my-app:7.2.1 in
Docker Hub or your private registry.

Correct

Correct. docker run first attempts to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub or
your private registry if the image is not already installed on your system. You
will only see this error message if Docker is unable to find the image.

The test stage forgot to run docker container create before executing docker
run.

Docker was not fully installed on this Jenkins node. Question 10 of 14 What is
the most correct explanation describing this command:

docker exec -i -t 2bf bash (Don't forget to use docker exec --help if you need
it!) This starts an interactive Bash shell within a container with ID 2bf with a
pseudo-TTY allocated to it.

Incorrect

Close. Container IDs are usually much longer than three characters. Therefore,
we can assume that we are starting a container that starts with this ID.

This starts a Bash shell within a container starting with ID 2bf with a
pseudo-TTY allocated to it. This starts an interactive Bash shell within a
container starting with ID 2bf.

Incorrect

This starts an interactive Bash shell within a container starting with ID 2bf
with a pseudo-TTY allocated to it.

Correct

Awesome job. -i is short for --interactive. --ty is short for TTY. Therefore,
this is precisely what this command is doing.

Question 11 of 14 You started a container that ran a single command. That
container has now exited. You would like to get the ID of this container for
additional reporting. Which of these commands will successfully complete this
task?

docker ps

docker inspect

docker logs docker ps -a

Correct

Nice. You need to add the -a or --all flag to see all containers on your system.
docker ps only shows you containers that are running.

Question 12 of 14 You are creating a Dockerfile for your web application that
will be pushed into your company's private Docker registry. Your application is
a NodeJS-based to-do list for keeping track of your team's Objectives and Key
Results, or OKRs. Your Dockerfile uses express as its webserver. Your terminal
hangs while trying to start a container from this image. You can't seem to exit
it, no matter how many keystrokes you provide. The application does not hang
when you run it normally on your computer. What is the most likely cause for
this happening?

This is a known bug in the express web server. Switch to nginx as your base
image. You ran docker run without providing the --interactive option and cannot
stop the web server hosting your web app.

Correct

Nice one. In order to provide keystrokes to your container, you need to provide
--interactive to tell Docker to enable keystrokes for this container.

You have an infinite loop in your application somewhere that only happens when
it is run within a Docker container.

You forgot to run docker container start after running docker container create.
Question 13 of 14 When would you want to bind a port on your computer to that of
a container?

When you want to save data from your container. When your container is running a
network service that you want to use from your computer.

Correct

When your container needs access to the Internet.

When your container is running a network service that you want to use from
within the container. Question 14 of 14 You are trying to remove 20 stopped
containers with docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm. However, upon doing this, you
receive the error below:

Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container
8dee53d9631c88d1bc431cffa562355f97c44e6120401a4a01c15def989e319b. Stop the
container before attempting removal or force remove

Which of these commands fixes this problem most efficiently?

docker system restart && docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm

docker container create --name
8dee53d9631c88d1bc431cffa562355f97c44e6120401a4a01c15def989e319b our-server &&
docker rm 8dee

for i in $(docker ps -aq); do docker rm -f $i; done docker ps -aq | xargs docker
rm -f

Correct
