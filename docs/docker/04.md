## **1. Unable to Create More Containers: Running Out of Space**

### **What Happened?**

- The user tried to run a new container but got an error indicating that there
  was no space left.
- Running `df -h` showed there was plenty of space on the disk, yet Docker
  couldn‚Äôt create containers.

### **Why Does This Happen?**

1. **Docker stores images, containers, volumes, and build cache in a specific
   location**.
   - On Linux: `/var/lib/docker`
   - On macOS/Windows (Docker Desktop): Inside a **virtual machine** (VM)
     managed by Docker.
2. Even if the host OS has space, **Docker‚Äôs internal storage might be full**
   inside its VM.
3. Possible causes:
   - Too many unused images.
   - Stale or stopped containers taking up space.
   - Unused volumes or caches.

### **Solutions**

#### **1. List and Remove Unused Images**

```sh
docker images
docker rmi <image_id>
```

- `docker images`: Lists all images.
- `docker rmi <image_id>`: Removes an image.
- Use `docker rmi -f <image_id>` to force removal if needed.

#### **2. Remove Stopped Containers**

```sh
docker ps -a          # Lists all containers, including stopped ones
docker rm <container_id>
```

#### **3. Free Up Space Using `docker system prune`**

```sh
docker system prune
```

- Removes stopped containers, dangling images, unused networks, and caches.
- Add `-a` to remove **all** unused images:
  ```sh
  docker system prune -a
  ```

#### **4. Check Disk Usage**

```sh
docker system df
```

- This shows how much space Docker is using for images, containers, and volumes.

## **2. Slow Running Containers**

### **What Happened?**

- A container was running slowly, even though it should have been fast.
- The instructor introduced three troubleshooting tools:
  1. `docker stats`
  2. `docker top`
  3. `docker inspect`

### **Key Debugging Tools**

#### **1. `docker stats`: Real-time Performance Monitoring**

```sh
docker stats
```

- Displays **CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O usage** for all running
  containers.
- Example output:
  ```
  CONTAINER ID   NAME     CPU %   MEM USAGE / LIMIT     NET I/O      BLOCK I/O
  a1b2c3d4e5f6   alpine   80.5%   10MiB / 2GiB         2.3kB / 4kB   0B / 0B
  ```
- Useful to check if:
  - **CPU is maxed out** (likely due to a runaway process).
  - **Memory is being exhausted** (could indicate a memory leak).
  - **High disk I/O** (slow storage operations).

#### **2. `docker top`: View Processes Running Inside a Container**

```sh
docker top <container_name>
```

- Equivalent to `top` or `ps` but for containers.
- Example output:
  ```
  UID       PID   PPID  C STIME TTY TIME     CMD
  root      1234  5678  0 10:30 ?   00:00:00 sleep infinity
  ```
- Helps identify:
  - Suspicious processes inside the container.
  - Runaway or unexpected processes.

#### **3. `docker inspect`: Detailed Container Info**

```sh
docker inspect <container_name>
```

- Returns **JSON-formatted** details about:
  - **Mounts** (volumes, bind mounts, etc.).
  - **Network settings** (IP, hostname, ports).
  - **Restart policies**.
  - **Environment variables**.
- Pipe it into `less` for easier reading:
  ```sh
  docker inspect <container_name> | less
  ```

## **3. Fixing a Broken Container**

### **What Happened?**

- The Dockerfile referenced a non-existent image (`ubuntu:xeniall` instead of
  `ubuntu:xenial`).
- The application script (`app.sh`) contained the `yes` command, which
  **consumed 100% CPU**.

### **Steps to Fix the Issue**

#### **1. Correct the Base Image in Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:xenial  # Fix typo
```

#### **2. Fix the `app.sh` Script**

- The `yes` command **causes high CPU usage** by printing `y` indefinitely.
- Remove the `yes` command from `app.sh`:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Processing..."
  sleep 2  # Simulate some work
  echo "Done!"
  ```
- Save and exit.

#### **3. Rebuild the Docker Image**

```sh
docker build -t app .
```

#### **4. Remove the Old Container**

```sh
docker rm app_container
```

#### **5. Run the Fixed Container**

```sh
docker run -it --name app_container app
```

## **Missed Details and Additional Considerations**

### **1. Preventing Storage Issues in the Future**

- Set **Docker‚Äôs disk usage limit** (Docker Desktop settings).
- Use **volume mounts** instead of copying large files into images.
- Regularly **prune unused containers and images**.

### **2. Detecting High CPU Usage Without `yes`**

- The transcript used `yes` as an artificial CPU load.
- In real-world cases, high CPU could be due to:
  - Infinite loops in applications.
  - Unoptimized database queries.
  - Too many processes running inside a container.

### **3. Using Logs for Debugging**

```sh
docker logs <container_name>
```

- Shows the output of the container.
- Useful for debugging errors or slow performance.

### **4. Avoiding ‚ÄúZombie‚Äù Containers**

- If a container exits but remains in `Exited` state:
  ```sh
  docker ps -a | grep Exited
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter "status=exited")
  ```
- Ensures containers don‚Äôt accumulate and waste space.

### **Questions for You to Check Understanding**

1. Why does running `df -h` show available space, but Docker still fails to
   create containers?
2. How does `docker system prune` help free up space?
3. What is the difference between `docker stats` and `docker top`?
4. Why did the `yes` command cause high CPU usage?
5. How do you fix a broken Dockerfile that references a non-existent image?

**Answers:**

1. Because Docker runs inside a virtual machine (VM) and the VM might be out of
   space.
2. It removes stopped containers, unused images, and cached layers.
3. `docker stats` shows real-time resource usage; `docker top` shows running
   processes.
4. `yes` prints "y" indefinitely, using up all CPU cycles.
5. Update the `FROM` line with the correct image name and tag.
