# Installing docker

## **What is Docker?**

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run
applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It helps solve the **"it
works on my machine"** problem by ensuring that an application behaves the same
way in any environmentâ€”whether on a developerâ€™s laptop, a testing server, or a
production cloud environment.

### **Why is Docker Useful?**

- **Eliminates Environment Inconsistencies**: Containers include all
  dependencies, so the app runs the same everywhere.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs), Docker
  containers share the host OS, making them lightweight and quick to start.
- **Scalability**: Applications can be quickly scaled up or down by deploying
  multiple containers.
- **Portability**: Containers can be easily moved across different environments
  (local, staging, production, cloud).

## **Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)**

| Feature                  | Virtual Machines          | Docker Containers                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtualization Level** | Hardware (via Hypervisor) | OS Kernel                                    |
| **Size**                 | Large (GBs)               | Small (MBs)                                  |
| **Boot Time**            | Slow (minutes)            | Fast (seconds)                               |
| **Resource Efficiency**  | Requires full OS per VM   | Shares host OS kernel                        |
| **Isolation**            | Stronger (full OS per VM) | Weaker (shares OS kernel)                    |
| **Performance**          | Slower due to emulation   | Faster since it runs directly on the host OS |

ðŸ’¡ **Key Difference**: Virtual machines emulate an entire computer, including
its OS. Containers only virtualize the application and its dependencies, using
the host OS's kernel.

## **The Anatomy of a Container**

A **Docker container** consists of:

1. **Namespaces**: Provide isolation for resources like processes, filesystems,
   and networking.
2. **Control Groups (cgroups)**: Limit CPU, memory, disk, and network usage for
   each container.
3. **Container Image**: A lightweight, standalone package with everything needed
   to run an application (code, runtime, dependencies, and libraries).

---

## **The Docker Difference**

Docker is not the first containerization technology, but it became popular due
to:

1. **Ease of Use**: Docker provides a simple CLI (`docker run`) and
   configuration (`Dockerfile`).
2. **Docker Hub**: A repository where users can share container images.
3. **Portability**: Ensures applications run the same in any environment.

### **Other Container Technologies**

- **Chroot (1979)**: Basic filesystem isolation.
- **BSD Jails (1999) & Solaris Zones (2004)**: More advanced isolation.
- **LXC (2007)**: Predecessor of modern Linux containers.

## **Docker Desktop**

Since Docker relies on **Linux namespaces and control groups**, it runs natively
on Linux. However, most developers use **Mac** or **Windows**.

### **How Docker Works on Non-Linux OS?**

1. **Docker Machine (Old Method)**: Used **VirtualBox** to create a small Linux
   VM. This was slow and complex.
2. **Docker Desktop (Current Method)**: Uses a **lightweight VM** with Apple's
   **VirtualKit** (Mac) or **WSL2/Hyper-V** (Windows), providing:
   - Faster performance.
   - GUI for easy configuration.
   - Automatic volume mounting and network handling.

ðŸ›‘ **License Note**: Companies with **250+ employees or $10M+ revenue** need a
**paid Docker Desktop license**.

## **Installing Docker**

### **Mac (Using Docker Desktop)**

1. **Download** Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com).
2. **Run the `.dmg` file** and drag it to the Applications folder.
3. **Open Docker** and accept the license agreement.
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm hello-world
   ```

ðŸ“Œ **Alternative**: Install using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask docker
```

---

### **Windows (Using Docker Desktop)**

1. **Download** Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com).
2. **Run the `.exe` file** and follow the setup wizard.
3. Choose **WSL2 backend** (recommended) or **Hyper-V**.
4. **Start Docker** from the Start menu.
5. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm hello-world
   ```

---

### **Linux (Using Docker Engine)**

1. **Install cURL**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install curl
   ```
2. **Download Dockerâ€™s Installation Script**:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh
   ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   sudo sh /tmp/get-docker.sh
   ```
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```
5. **Run Docker Without `sudo`**:
   ```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
