In this step, we explore how you can interact with your REST API using **HAL
Explorer**.

## üåê What is HAL?

HAL stands for **Hypertext Application Language**, a simple format providing a
consistent way to hyperlink between resources in RESTful APIs.

We already enhanced our "Get a specific user" API to return a link to all users.
The returned format uses the HAL structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Adam",
  "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
  "_links": {
    "all-users": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/users"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîç What is HAL Explorer?

HAL Explorer is an **API explorer** for RESTful Hypermedia APIs using HAL. It
provides a user interface to navigate your HAL-compliant API.

### üí° Benefits

- Makes APIs navigable even for non-technical users.
- Automatically integrates with Spring Boot.

## üß± Step-by-Step: Setting up HAL Explorer

### 1. Add Dependency

In your `pom.xml`, add the following:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Restart the Application

Once the dependency is downloaded:

- Stop the server.
- Start it again.

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you will see the **HAL
Explorer UI**.

## üß≠ Exploring APIs with HAL Explorer

### Example: Actuator Endpoints

1. In HAL Explorer, type `/actuator` in the input box and click **Go**.
2. You'll see `_links` like:
   - `beans`
   - `health`
   - `metrics`

You can click on each and send a `GET` request via the UI.

#### Beans Endpoint

```http
GET /actuator/beans
```

- Returns all Spring beans.
- Explorer shows the JSON response parsed into data and links.

#### Metrics Endpoint

```http
GET /actuator/metrics
```

- Lists application metrics (e.g., `http.server.requests`).

#### Custom API: `/users/1`

```http
GET /users/1
```

- Returns user data (e.g., name, birth date).
- Also includes HAL `_links`, such as `all-users`.
- HAL Explorer shows both the data and available links.

## üß™ Try It Yourself

:::note

Exercise: Enable HAL Explorer and navigate to your `/users` API.

- Explore both actuator and user APIs.
- Observe how HAL Explorer splits `data` and `_links`. 

:::

## üìå Summary

- HAL enables linking between REST resources.
- HAL Explorer provides a visual interface to navigate these resources.
- Spring Boot auto-configures HAL Explorer when the dependency is added.

Useful for developers **and** non-technical stakeholders to understand and
interact with REST APIs.
