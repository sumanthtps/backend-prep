## üß† What is CSRF?

**CSRF** stands for _Cross-Site Request Forgery_. It's a type of attack where a user is tricked into performing unintended actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.

This attack exploits the trust a website has in a user‚Äôs browser by **reusing their session credentials** (like cookies) to perform actions without consent.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Example

1. User logs into `https://yourbank.com` (authenticated).
2. In another tab, they visit a malicious site.
3. That site silently sends a request:

   ```html
   <img src="https://yourbank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=hacker" />
   ```

4. The bank processes the transfer ‚Äî **because the user was authenticated**.

## üõ°Ô∏è CSRF Protection in Spring Security

Spring Security **enables CSRF protection by default** for state-changing requests:

| HTTP Method | CSRF Protection |
|-------------|------------------|
| `GET`       | ‚ùå Not Required   |
| `POST`      | ‚úÖ Required       |
| `PUT`       | ‚úÖ Required       |
| `DELETE`    | ‚úÖ Required       |

If CSRF is enabled and the request lacks a valid token, Spring Security returns:

```http
403 Forbidden - Invalid CSRF Token
```

---

## ‚úÖ When You Can Disable CSRF

It‚Äôs safe to disable CSRF in **stateless** REST APIs (e.g., APIs using `HTTP Basic Auth` or `JWT`) because they don‚Äôt use cookies.

```java
http.csrf().disable();
```

You should disable CSRF only if:

- Your API is **stateless** (no session/cookies).
- You're using authentication mechanisms like:
  - Basic Auth
  - Bearer Tokens
  - JWT

## üí° CSRF Token Flow (in Web Apps)

```plaintext
1. Server sends a form with a CSRF token.
2. Browser submits form, including the token.
3. Server verifies the token.
   - ‚úÖ Match ‚Üí process request.
   - ‚ùå Mismatch ‚Üí 403 Forbidden.
```

## üìå Summary

- CSRF is a **web attack** that uses a user‚Äôs browser session to send unauthorized requests.
- **Spring Security protects against CSRF by default** for POST/PUT/DELETE requests.
- Disable CSRF **only** for **stateless REST APIs** (non-cookie-based).
- Use **CSRF tokens** for traditional web apps with forms and sessions.
