title: Basic Security to REST API with Spring Security
sidebar_label: Basic Spring Security
---

By default, our Spring Boot REST API is **open to the world**—anyone can view or
modify data. In this section, we secure the API using **Spring Security**,
adding basic **authentication** and eventually customizing credentials.

---

## 🧠 Why REST API Security Matters

Without authentication or authorization:

- Anyone can make GET or POST requests
- Anyone can view sensitive data
- Anyone can create or delete resources

> 🧱 **REST APIs must be secured before going to production**, or your backend
> becomes a free-for-all.

## 🔐 What is Spring Security?

**Spring Security** is a framework that provides authentication, authorization,
and protection against common attacks (like CSRF).

### Key Features:

- Automatic login form
- Password encoding and role-based access
- Secures all endpoints by default

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. Add Spring Security to `pom.xml`

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Spring Boot auto-configures basic security once this dependency is added.

### 2. Restart Application

After adding the dependency:

- Restart your Spring Boot application
- You will see a **generated password** in the console:
  ```
  Using generated security password: e6f8ad3c-...
  ```

---

## 🧪 Try Accessing the API (Without Login)

### 🔄 In Browser

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/users
```

🔒 Redirected to a login form.

---

### 📤 In Talend API Tester

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/users
```

Headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane",
  "birthDate": "2000-01-01"
}
```

⛔ **401 Unauthorized** – No authentication provided

---

## ✅ Add Basic Authentication

### Option 1: Use Temporary Credentials

#### Login Credentials

- **Username:** `user`
- **Password:** (generated in console)

#### Talend Authorization Header

```http
Authorization: Basic base64(user:generated-password)
```

Or use Talend's built-in Basic Auth setup.

---

## 🧰 Configure Static Username & Password

Changing credentials each time is not ideal. Let's set custom credentials:

### 3. Add to `application.properties`

```properties
spring.security.user.name=username
spring.security.user.password=password
```

### 4. Restart Application

Now:

- No generated password is printed
- You can always log in with:
  - **Username:** `username`
  - **Password:** `password`

---

## 🧪 Testing New Credentials

### 🔁 In Browser

Visit:

```http
http://localhost:8080/users
```

🔐 You'll be prompted for the username/password you configured.

---

### 📤 In Talend API Tester

Update headers:

```http
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
```

✅ You will now get a successful response.

---

## 🛡️ What Spring Security Secures by Default

Once added, Spring Security **protects all routes** in your app unless
explicitly marked public.

This includes:

- `/users`
- `/users/{id}`
- `/jpa/users`
- Any other REST endpoints

You must now **authenticate every request** to use the API.

## 📘 Summary

| Feature                 | Before Security      | After Spring Security     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Authentication          | ❌ None              | ✅ Basic login + password |
| Access to all endpoints | ✅ Public            | 🔐 Auth required          |
| Auto-generated password | ❌ N/A               | ✅ Generated if not set   |
| Talend usage            | 🔓 No headers needed | ✅ Authorization required |

> ✅ Spring Security is a plug-and-play security system that protects all
> endpoints out of the box.

## 🧪 Mini Quiz

:::quiz

### What happens if you don’t configure a password in `application.properties`?

- [ ] Spring disables security
- [x] Spring generates a temporary password
- [ ] You can access everything freely
- [ ] It throws a runtime error :::

:::quiz

### Which file is used to set static credentials?

- [ ] `pom.xml`
- [ ] `security-config.json`
- [x] `application.properties`
- [ ] `WebSecurityConfig.java` :::

## 🧪 Hands-On Exercise

:::exercise **Goal**: Secure your API using Spring Security

1. Add Spring Security to `pom.xml`
2. Restart and note the generated password
3. Try accessing `http://localhost:8080/users` without authentication
4. Use the generated credentials to login
5. Now set these in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.security.user.name=admin
   spring.security.user.password=admin123
   ```
6. Restart app and verify login using Talend API Tester

✅ Your API is now secured! :::
