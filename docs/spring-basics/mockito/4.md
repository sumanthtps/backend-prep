In this step, the instructor explains how to replace stubs with mocks using
**Mockito** in unit testing. The primary focus is on using `mock()` and `when()`
to define mock behavior, eliminating the need to create stub classes manually.

1. **Refactoring from Stubs to Mocks**
2. **Creating Mocks using Mockito**
3. **Defining Behavior for Mocks**
4. **Running and Verifying the Unit Test**
5. **Advantages of Using Mocks Over Stubs**

## **1. Refactoring from Stubs to Mocks**

Previously, a **stub** was used to provide test data, but now we will use
**mocks**.

### **Stub Example:**

```java
class DataServiceStub implements DataService {
    @Override
    public int[] retrieveAllData() {
        return new int[]{24, 6, 15};
    }
}
```

This stub was explicitly returning a fixed dataset.

Now, instead of a stub, we will use **Mockito to create a mock**.

---

## **2. Creating Mocks using Mockito**

Mockito provides a `mock(Class<T> classToMock)` method to create a mock of a
class or an interface.

### **Mock Example:**

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;

DataService dataServiceMock = mock(DataService.class);
```

This creates a **mock object** of `DataService`, but it doesnâ€™t yet return any
values.

---

## **3. Defining Behavior for Mocks**

Mocks **do not return data by default**. If we call
`dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()`, it returns `null` unless we define a
behavior using `when()`.

### **Fixing the NullPointerException**

The test was failing because:

```java
dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData();
```

was returning `null`. To fix this, we define expected behavior using
`when().thenReturn()`.

### **Mocking a Method to Return Data**

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{24, 6, 15});
```

This ensures that whenever `retrieveAllData()` is called, it returns
`{24, 6, 15}`.

---

## **4. Running and Verifying the Unit Test**

Now, we run the test and ensure that it returns the expected result.

### **Complete Test Code:**

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class SomeBusinessImplMockTest {

    @Test
    void testFindTheGreatestFromAllData() {
        // Create a mock of DataService
        DataService dataServiceMock = mock(DataService.class);

        // Define behavior for the mock
        when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{24, 6, 15});

        // Use the mock in the business logic
        SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl = new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceMock);

        // Assert that the method finds the greatest number correctly
        assertEquals(24, businessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
    }
}
```

### **Expected Output:**

âœ… Test passes successfully!

## **5. Advantages of Using Mocks Over Stubs**

### **Why Mocks?**

1. **Easier to Write and Maintain**
   - No need to create multiple stub classes.
   - Mocks can be modified dynamically.
2. **More Flexible**
   - We can easily change return values using `when().thenReturn()`.
3. **Scalability**
   - Adding new test cases requires **only one line** to modify behavior:
     ```java
     when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{35});
     ```

---

## **Additional Concepts Not Covered in the Transcript**

### **Mocking Multiple Scenarios**

We can create **multiple test cases** easily by changing the return values of
the mock.

```java
@Test
void testFindTheGreatestWithOneValue() {
    DataService dataServiceMock = mock(DataService.class);
    when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{35});

    SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl = new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceMock);

    assertEquals(35, businessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
}
```

### **Verifying Mock Interactions**

We can **verify** if a method was actually called using `verify()`.

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

verify(dataServiceMock).retrieveAllData();
```

This ensures `retrieveAllData()` was invoked.

---

## **Questions**

### **1. Why did the test initially fail with a `NullPointerException`?**

- **Answer:** Because `dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()` returned `null` by
  default, which caused the business logic to fail when trying to process it.

### **2. What is the purpose of `mock(Class<T> classToMock)`?**

- **Answer:** It creates a mock instance of a class or interface that can be
  used in unit tests without relying on real implementations.

### **3. What is the difference between stubs and mocks?**

- **Answer:**
  - **Stubs:** Hardcoded implementations returning fixed data.
  - **Mocks:** Dynamic objects whose behavior is defined using
    `Mockito.when().thenReturn()`. Mocks provide more flexibility.

### **4. How can we verify that a method was called in Mockito?**

- **Answer:** By using `verify(mockInstance).methodName()`, e.g.:
  ```java
  verify(dataServiceMock).retrieveAllData();
  ```
  This ensures that `retrieveAllData()` was actually called in the test.

### **5. How can we handle exceptions using Mockito?**

- **Answer:** We can use `thenThrow()` to simulate exceptions.
  ```java
  when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenThrow(new RuntimeException("Service error"));
  ```
  This is useful for testing error handling in business logic.

## **Final Thoughts**

Mockito makes **unit testing easy** by allowing us to create **mocks** instead
of **stubs**, giving more flexibility and maintainability. In the next step,
we'll see how to simplify this even further! ðŸš€
