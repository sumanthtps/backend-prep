#### **Introduction to Mockito**

Mockito is the most widely used mocking framework in Java for unit testing. It
helps developers isolate specific components of an application by creating
**mock objects** to replace real dependencies.

#### **Why Do We Need Mocking?**

In a real-world application, different layers interact with each other:

1. **Web Layer** â€“ Handles user requests (e.g., controllers in Spring MVC).
2. **Business Layer** â€“ Implements business logic (e.g., service classes).
3. **Data Layer** â€“ Handles database operations (e.g., repository classes).

Each class in the business layer might depend on multiple other classes. Writing
**unit tests** for these classes without depending on actual databases, external
services, or APIs makes testing faster, more reliable, and independent. This is
where **mocking** comes into play.

#### **Challenges in Writing Unit Tests**

- Dependencies make unit testing harder.
- A unit test should **only test one unit** of code, not its dependencies.
- A business layer unit test should not depend on a real database.

To solve this, we use **Stubs and Mocks**.

### **What Are Stubs and Mocks?**

#### **1. Stubs**

A **stub** is a simple, hardcoded object that provides predefined responses.
Stubs are typically static and donâ€™t provide flexibility.

**Example:**  
Imagine a business layer class that fetches products from a database. Instead of
calling the real database, we create a **stub**:

```java
class ProductRepositoryStub extends ProductRepository {
    @Override
    public List<String> getAllProducts() {
        return Arrays.asList("Laptop", "Mobile", "Tablet");
    }
}
```

Here, the stub returns a hardcoded list of products without connecting to a real
database.

#### **2. Mocks**

A **mock** is a dynamically created object that mimics the behavior of real
objects and allows verification of interactions.

**Example using Mockito:**

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class ProductServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private ProductService productService;

    @Test
    void testGetAllProducts() {
        when(productRepository.getAllProducts()).thenReturn(Arrays.asList("Laptop", "Mobile", "Tablet"));

        List<String> products = productService.getAllProducts();

        assertEquals(3, products.size());
        verify(productRepository, times(1)).getAllProducts();
    }
}
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:

1. `@Mock` â€“ Creates a mock of `ProductRepository`.
2. `@InjectMocks` â€“ Injects the mock into `ProductService`.
3. `when(...).thenReturn(...)` â€“ Specifies what the mock should return.
4. `verify(...)` â€“ Ensures the mock was used correctly.

### **How Mockito Helps**

Mockito simplifies creating mocks and verifying interactions, making unit tests:

- **Faster** (no database calls).
- **Reliable** (independent of external factors).
- **Focused** (tests only the unit under test).

### **Questions Based on the Transcript**

1. **Why do we need mocking in unit tests?**
2. **What are the three main layers in an application?**
3. **What is the difference between stubs and mocks?**
4. **How does Mockito simplify unit testing?**
5. **Which Mockito annotations are commonly used?**

### **Answers to the Questions**

1. **Mocking helps in isolating a unit of code by replacing real dependencies,
   making tests faster, reliable, and independent.**
2. **Web Layer, Business Layer, and Data Layer.**
3. **Stubs return predefined responses, while mocks dynamically simulate
   behavior and verify interactions.**
4. **Mockito automates mock creation, method stubbing, and interaction
   verification.**
5. **`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`,
   `when(...).thenReturn(...)`, `verify(...)`.**
