# Mockito annotations

---

### **Overview**

In this step, the instructor explains how to simplify unit tests by using
**Mockito annotations** (`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, and
`@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`). These annotations help in **automating
the mock creation and injection**, reducing the amount of boilerplate code in
tests.

---

## **1. Why Use Mockito Annotations?**

Before using annotations, we were creating and injecting mocks manually:

```java
DataService dataServiceMock = mock(DataService.class);
SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl = new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceMock);
```

Now, Mockito provides annotations to **automate this process**.

---

## **2. Key Annotations Used**

### **2.1 `@Mock` (Creating Mocks)**

Instead of manually calling `mock(Class<T> classToMock)`, we can use `@Mock` to
create a mock object automatically.

```java
@Mock
private DataService dataServiceMock;
```

This **automatically** initializes `dataServiceMock` as a **mocked object**.

---

### **2.2 `@InjectMocks` (Injecting Mocks into a Class)**

Instead of manually passing the mock object to the constructor:

```java
SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl = new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceMock);
```

We can **automate this** using:

```java
@InjectMocks
private SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl;
```

This tells Mockito to **inject all mocks** (like `dataServiceMock`) into the
`SomeBusinessImpl` instance **automatically**.

---

### **2.3 `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` (Enable Mockito in JUnit 5)**

Mockito needs an **extension** to process annotations. Without it, `@Mock` and
`@InjectMocks` **will not work**.

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
```

This replaces the `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this)` call (which was required
in JUnit 4).

---

## **3. Implementing the Annotations in a Test**

Hereâ€™s the **simplified test code** using annotations:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)  // Enable Mockito annotations
class SomeBusinessImplMockTest {

    @Mock  // Create a mock of DataService
    private DataService dataServiceMock;

    @InjectMocks  // Inject the mock into SomeBusinessImpl
    private SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl;

    @Test
    void testFindTheGreatestFromAllData() {
        // Define behavior for the mock
        when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{24, 6, 15});

        // Test the business logic
        assertEquals(24, businessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
    }

    @Test
    void testFindTheGreatestWithOneValue() {
        when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{35});

        assertEquals(35, businessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
    }

    @Test
    void testFindTheGreatestWithEmptyArray() {
        when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[]{});

        assertEquals(Integer.MIN_VALUE, businessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Running the Tests**

Now, running the tests will be successful because:

1. `@Mock` **creates the mock**.
2. `@InjectMocks` **injects the mock into the business logic**.
3. `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` **enables annotation processing**.

âœ… **All tests pass successfully!**

## **5. Advantages of Using Mockito Annotations**

| Feature              | Without Annotations (Manual)             | With Annotations (Automated)                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mock Creation        | `mock(DataService.class);`               | `@Mock private DataService dataServiceMock;`          |
| Dependency Injection | `new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceMock);` | `@InjectMocks private SomeBusinessImpl businessImpl;` |
| Initialization       | Explicitly initialize mocks              | Uses `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`            |

ðŸ”¹ **Less boilerplate code**  
ðŸ”¹ **Easier to maintain and extend tests**  
ðŸ”¹ **Automatic mock injection, even with multiple dependencies**

## **6. Additional Concepts Not Covered in the Transcript**

### **6.1 Verifying Method Calls**

We can verify whether a method was called using:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

verify(dataServiceMock).retrieveAllData();
```

This ensures `retrieveAllData()` was called in the test.

---

### **6.2 Handling Exceptions in Mocks**

If we want to simulate an exception being thrown:

```java
when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenThrow(new RuntimeException("Service error"));
```

This is useful for testing error handling.

---

## **7. Questions and Answers**

### **Q1: Why did we get a `NullPointerException` before using `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`?**

- **Answer:** Mockito annotations (`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`) do not work
  automatically. We need `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` to enable
  annotation processing.

### **Q2: How does `@InjectMocks` work when there are multiple dependencies?**

- **Answer:** `@InjectMocks` will **inject all mocks** (annotated with `@Mock`)
  into the constructor or setter methods of the target class.

### **Q3: What happens if we donâ€™t use `@Mock` but manually instantiate the object?**

- **Answer:** The object will be a real instance instead of a mock, leading to
  actual method execution instead of returning predefined values.

### **Q4: Can we use Mockito with static methods?**

- **Answer:** No, Mockito does not support mocking static methods. For that, we
  use **PowerMockito**.

### **Q5: What value does `findTheGreatestFromAllData()` return when given an empty array?**

- **Answer:** It returns `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which indicates a bug in the
  logic. A better approach could be returning `Optional<Integer>`.

## **Final Thoughts**

With `@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, and `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`, **unit
tests become cleaner and easier to manage**.  
In the next step, we'll see even **more ways** to optimize our tests! ðŸš€
