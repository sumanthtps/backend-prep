# Containers vs Virtual Machines

To understand Docker, we need to compare it with **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.

---

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

- Run a **full operating system** on top of a hypervisor.  
- Each VM includes:
  - Guest OS kernel.  
  - Libraries and dependencies.  
  - Application.  

**Drawback:** Heavy, slow to boot, consumes large disk/memory.

---

## Containers

- Share the **host OS kernel**.  
- Include:
  - App code.  
  - Required libraries/dependencies.  
- No need for a full OS inside each instance.  
- Lightweight, fast, portable.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature             | Virtual Machine (VM)                 | Docker Container                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| OS Layer            | Has its own full OS + kernel         | Shares host OS kernel             |
| Size                | Gigabytes                           | Megabytes                         |
| Boot Time           | Minutes                             | Seconds                           |
| Isolation           | Strong isolation (full OS)          | Process-level isolation           |
| Use Case            | Multi-OS environments (Linux/Win)   | Fast app packaging and deployment |

## Visual Explanation (in words)

- **VMs**: Imagine running 10 operating systems at once, each with its own baggage.  
- **Containers**: Imagine running 10 apps on the same OS, each neatly boxed with what it needs.

## Questions & Answers

**Q1. Why are containers faster than VMs?**  
Because they reuse the host OS kernel instead of booting a full OS.  

**Q2. Can containers run Windows apps on a Linux host?**  
No, containers must share the same kernel type. A Linux host can only run Linux containers.
