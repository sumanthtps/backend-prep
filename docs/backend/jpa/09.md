# Magic of JPA

### **EntityManager and SQL Queries in JPA**

#### **1. Transition from Spring JDBC to JPA**

- In **Spring JDBC**, developers write a lot of SQL queries but less Java code.
- **JPA** eliminates the need to write SQL queries manually.
- Instead, entities are mapped to tables, and JPA operations are performed using
  **EntityManager**.

#### **2. EntityManager and Its Methods**

- **EntityManager** is the primary interface for managing entities in JPA.
- It provides methods to perform database operations:
  - `merge(entity)`: Inserts or updates an entity.
  - `find(Class<T>, Object primaryKey)`: Retrieves an entity by its primary key.
  - `remove(entity)`: Deletes an entity.

##### **Example: Using EntityManager**

```java
import jakarta.persistence.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class CourseJpaRepository {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    public void insert(Course course) {
        entityManager.merge(course);
    }

    public Course findById(Long id) {
        return entityManager.find(Course.class, id);
    }

    public void deleteById(Long id) {
        Course course = entityManager.find(Course.class, id);
        if (course != null) {
            entityManager.remove(course);
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways:**

- `EntityManager` handles database operations without requiring SQL.
- Developers focus on managing objects, while SQL execution happens
  automatically.

### **Behind the Scenes: SQL Queries Executed by JPA**

- Although JPA eliminates the need to write SQL, it still generates queries
  internally.
- Queries can be viewed by enabling logging in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

- The **CourseCommandLineRunner** executes JPA operations, and we can observe
  the queries it generates.

#### **1. Insert Operations**

- When inserting data, JPA first checks if the entity exists.
- If no existing row matches the ID, it performs an `INSERT` operation.

##### **Generated SQL for Insert:**

```sql
SELECT id, name, author FROM course WHERE id = ?
INSERT INTO course (id, name, author) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
```

#### **2. Delete Operations**

- Before deleting, JPA first **retrieves the entity**.
- The `find()` method executes a `SELECT` query before `DELETE`.

##### **Generated SQL for Delete:**

```sql
SELECT id, name, author FROM course WHERE id = ?
DELETE FROM course WHERE id = ?
```

ðŸ“Œ **Why is there a SELECT before DELETE?**

- JPA ensures that the entity exists before deleting it.
- This prevents errors caused by attempting to delete non-existent records.

#### **3. Find by ID Operation**

- The `findById()` method executes a `SELECT` query.

##### **Generated SQL for Find by ID:**

```sql
SELECT id, name, author FROM course WHERE id = ?
```

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaway:**  
Even though JPA hides SQL queries from developers, it still executes standard
SQL in the background.

### **Why Do We Need Spring Data JPA?**

- Using `EntityManager` simplifies database interactions compared to JDBC.
- However, **Spring Data JPA** provides additional benefits:
  - Reduces boilerplate code further.
  - Provides built-in repository interfaces like `JpaRepository`.
  - Supports advanced query generation without writing SQL.
- This raises the question: **Why should we move from JPA to Spring Data JPA?**
- The next step will explore **Spring Data JPA** and how it improves upon basic
  JPA.

### **Questions for Understanding**

1. **What is the role of `EntityManager` in JPA?**
2. **Why does JPA execute a `SELECT` query before performing a `DELETE`
   operation?**
3. **How can we enable SQL logging to see queries executed by JPA?**
4. **What is the difference between `merge()` and `persist()` in JPA?**
5. **Why would we consider using Spring Data JPA instead of manually managing an
   `EntityManager`?**

---

### **Answers**

1. **`EntityManager` is used to manage entities in JPA, allowing developers to
   perform insert, update, delete, and query operations without writing SQL.**
2. **JPA executes a `SELECT` query before `DELETE` to ensure that the entity
   exists in the database before attempting to remove it.**
3. **Enable `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` in `application.properties` to log SQL
   queries executed by JPA.**
4. **`merge()` is used for both inserting and updating an entity, while
   `persist()` is used only for inserting a new entity and does not update
   existing ones.**
5. **Spring Data JPA eliminates the need to manage `EntityManager` manually by
   providing repository interfaces with built-in methods for common database
   operations.**
