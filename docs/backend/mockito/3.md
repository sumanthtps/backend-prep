title: Unit tests with stubs
sidebar-position: 1
---

In this step, we **write a unit test using stubs** for `SomeBusinessImpl`. This
helps us test the business logic without using a real database or an external
service.

---

## **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. Where Do We Write Unit Tests?**

Unit tests are placed inside:  
ðŸ“‚ **`src/test/java`** â†’ This ensures that test code is separate from production
code.

---

### **2. Creating a Unit Test for `SomeBusinessImpl`**

We follow the naming convention:  
ðŸ“Œ **Test class name = Business class name + `Test`**  
So, we create **`SomeBusinessImplTest`** inside the `business` package.

#### **Basic Test Class Without Stubbing**

```java
package com.in28minutes.mockito.business;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class SomeBusinessImplTest {

    @Test
    void testFindGreatestFromAllData() {
        SomeBusinessImpl business = new SomeBusinessImpl(null); // Passing null for DataService
        int result = business.findGreatestFromAllData();
        assertEquals(0, result); // This will fail because dataService is null
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **What happens when we run this?**  
âœ… A **NullPointerException** occurs because `dataService` is `null`.

---

### **3. Fixing the NullPointerException with Constructor Injection**

To avoid `NullPointerException`, we add a **constructor** to inject
`DataService` into `SomeBusinessImpl`.

#### **Updated `SomeBusinessImpl`**

```java
public class SomeBusinessImpl {
    private DataService dataService;

    public SomeBusinessImpl(DataService dataService) {
        this.dataService = dataService;
    }

    public int findGreatestFromAllData() {
        int[] data = dataService.retrieveAllData();
        int greatestValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int value : data) {
            if (value > greatestValue) {
                greatestValue = value;
            }
        }
        return greatestValue;
    }
}
```

âœ… **Now, we can inject a `DataService` implementation using stubs.**

---

### **4. Creating a Stub for `DataService`**

A **stub** is a simple hardcoded implementation of an interface.

#### **Stub Implementation of `DataService`**

```java
class DataServiceStub implements DataService {
    @Override
    public int[] retrieveAllData() {
        return new int[]{25, 15, 5}; // Hardcoded values
    }
}
```

âœ… Now, instead of using a real database, we use `DataServiceStub` to return
test data.

---

### **5. Using the Stub in the Unit Test**

```java
package com.in28minutes.mockito.business;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

class SomeBusinessImplTest {

    @Test
    void testFindGreatestFromAllData_BasicScenario() {
        DataServiceStub dataServiceStub = new DataServiceStub();
        SomeBusinessImpl business = new SomeBusinessImpl(dataServiceStub);

        int result = business.findGreatestFromAllData();
        assertEquals(25, result); // Expected output: 25
    }
}
```

âœ… **Now, the test passes because**:

- `SomeBusinessImpl` calls `DataServiceStub`, which returns `{25, 15, 5}`.
- The greatest number (`25`) is correctly identified.

---

### **6. Problems with Stubs**

Although stubs work, **they have major drawbacks**:

#### **ðŸ”´ Problem 1: Every Time We Add a New Method, We Must Update Stubs**

- If `DataService` adds a new method (e.g., `retrieveDataById()`),  
  **we must update all stub classes**.

#### **ðŸ”´ Problem 2: Testing Multiple Scenarios Requires Multiple Stubs**

- If we want to test different data sets, we must create multiple stubs:

```java
class DataServiceStub1 implements DataService {
    @Override
    public int[] retrieveAllData() {
        return new int[]{100, 200, 300};
    }
}

class DataServiceStub2 implements DataService {
    @Override
    public int[] retrieveAllData() {
        return new int[]{1};
    }
}
```

- Then, we **manually swap between `Stub1`, `Stub2`, `Stub3`**, etc.
- This **creates unnecessary duplication and maintenance issues**.

---

## **Conclusion**

Using **stubs** for unit testing works, but **it becomes unmanageable** as
complexity increases. Instead of hardcoding test data in separate classes, we
should use **mocks**, which are dynamic and flexible.

ðŸ“Œ **Next Step:** Explore **Mockito** for better test flexibility. ðŸš€

## **Questions Based on the Transcript**

1. **Why did we get a `NullPointerException` in our first test?**
2. **How did we fix the `NullPointerException` in `SomeBusinessImpl`?**
3. **What is a stub? How does it help in unit testing?**
4. **What are the two main problems with using stubs?**
5. **Why are mocks preferred over stubs?**

---

## **Answers to the Questions**

1. **Because `dataService` was `null`, and `retrieveAllData()` was being called
   on it.**
2. **By using constructor injection to pass a `DataService` instance to
   `SomeBusinessImpl`.**
3. **A stub is a hardcoded implementation of an interface that returns
   predefined data for testing. It allows us to test business logic without
   using real dependencies.**
4.  - If `DataService` changes, all stubs must be updated. 
    - Multiple test
   scenarios require creating multiple stub classes, making maintenance
   difficult.**
5. **Mocks allow us to define test behavior dynamically, without creating
   multiple hardcoded classes. This makes testing more flexible and
   maintainable.**
