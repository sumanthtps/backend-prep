### **Understanding the World Before Spring Boot**

Before Spring Boot, setting up and maintaining **Spring-based applications** was
complex and time-consuming. Letâ€™s break down the challenges with examples.

---

## **1. Dependency Management Was Complex**

When building a **REST API** using Spring, developers had to manually manage
multiple dependencies in `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle).

For example, to set up a **Spring MVC project**, you needed to include:

- **Spring Core**
- **Spring MVC**
- **Jackson (for JSON binding)**
- **Logging framework (like Log4j or SLF4J)**
- **JUnit and Mockito (for testing)**

### **Example: A Typical `pom.xml` File (Before Spring Boot)**

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Core -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.9</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Spring MVC -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.9</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Jackson for JSON -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Logging (SLF4J + Logback) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
        <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.6</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- JUnit & Mockito for Testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.2</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
        <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.11.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

ðŸ’¡ **Problem**:

- Developers had to manually find and update compatible **versions** for each
  dependency.
- A minor update could cause **dependency conflicts**.
- Each new project required **repeating this setup**, which could take days.

---

## **2. Web Configuration Was Tedious (`web.xml`)**

Before Spring Boot, every **web application** required a `web.xml` file for
configuring the **DispatcherServlet**, which handles incoming requests.

### **Example: web.xml Configuration (Before Spring Boot)**

```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="3.0">
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
            <param-value>/WEB-INF/spring-servlet.xml</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```

ðŸ’¡ **Problems**:

- This XML file had to be manually written and maintained.
- The **DispatcherServlet** setup was mandatory for every web project.
- Developers had to **manually load the Spring application context**.

---

## **3. Additional Spring Configuration Was Required**

Developers also needed to configure additional **Spring settings** in another
XML file (`spring-servlet.xml`).

### **Example: Spring Configuration (Before Spring Boot)**

```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.controller" />
<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
    <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/views/" />
    <property name="suffix" value=".jsp" />
</bean>
```

ðŸ’¡ **Problems**:

- Developers had to define **Component Scanning** and **View Resolvers**
  manually.
- If the application used a database, additional configuration for **DataSource,
  EntityManager, and Transactions** was required.

---

## **4. Manually Implementing Non-Functional Features**

A real-world application needs more than just a working API. It requires:

- **Logging**
- **Error handling**
- **Monitoring**
- **Metrics collection**
- **Security (Authentication & Authorization)**

Before Spring Boot, developers had to **manually integrate these features**.

### **Example: Manual Logging Setup**

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyService {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);

    public void performTask() {
        logger.info("Task started");
        try {
            // Business logic
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Error occurred", e);
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Problems**:

- Developers had to manually **configure** the logging framework (Logback,
  Log4j, etc.).
- Setting up monitoring tools required **external dependencies** like Prometheus
  or JMX.
- Each project had to **repeat this setup from scratch**.

---

## **5. Time-Consuming Project Setup**

Setting up a **Spring-based application** typically took **days** due to:

1. **Dependency management**
2. **Manual configurations (`web.xml`, `spring-servlet.xml`)**
3. **Setting up non-functional requirements**
4. **Configuring a web server** (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)
5. **Ensuring all configurations work together**

Every new project required **repeating** this setup, making maintenance harder
over time.

---

## **How Does Spring Boot Solve These Problems?**

Spring Boot was designed to **remove** this complexity by providing:  
âœ… **Spring Boot Starters** â†’ Predefined dependencies (no version conflicts).  
âœ… **Auto-Configuration** â†’ Eliminates `web.xml` and manual configurations.  
âœ… **Embedded Web Server** â†’ No need for external Tomcat/Jetty setup.  
âœ… **Production-Ready Features** â†’ Built-in logging, error handling, and
monitoring.

### **Example: Spring Boot Simplified REST API**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class SpringBootApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootApp.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

ðŸ”¹ **No XML configuration needed!**  
ðŸ”¹ **Embedded Tomcat starts automatically.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Dependencies are managed via Spring Boot Starters.**

## **Questions Based on This Explanation**

1. Why was **dependency management** difficult before Spring Boot?
2. What role did `web.xml` play in traditional Spring applications?
3. Why did developers need `spring-servlet.xml` before Spring Boot?
4. What non-functional features had to be **manually implemented** before Spring
   Boot?
5. How did project setup time compare **before and after Spring Boot**?
6. What is the main **advantage** of Spring Bootâ€™s **Auto-Configuration**?
7. How does Spring Boot handle **server configuration differently**?

---

## **Answers**

1. **Dependency management was difficult** because developers had to manually
   define each dependency and ensure version compatibility, which often led to
   conflicts.

2. **`web.xml` was required** to manually configure the **DispatcherServlet**,
   which handled incoming web requests in Spring MVC applications.

3. **`spring-servlet.xml` was needed** to define additional Spring
   configurations like **Component Scanning**, **View Resolvers**, and **Data
   Sources**.

4. **Non-functional features manually implemented before Spring Boot**:

   - **Logging** (SLF4J, Logback, or Log4j)
   - **Error Handling** (Custom Exception Handlers)
   - **Monitoring & Metrics** (External tools like JMX, Prometheus)
   - **Security** (Manually configuring Spring Security)

5. **Project setup time** before Spring Boot could take **days**, while Spring
   Boot projects can be set up in **minutes** with **Spring Initializr**.

6. **Spring Bootâ€™s Auto-Configuration** eliminates manual configurations by
   **detecting dependencies and applying sensible defaults automatically**.

7. **Spring Boot handles server configuration differently** by including an
   **embedded web server** (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), so no external
   deployment is needed.
