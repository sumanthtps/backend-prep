# 🚪 Introduction to Monolith Applications

Before microservices architecture became popular, most enterprise and
large-scale applications were built as **monoliths**.

Let’s explore what a monolithic application is, the **key challenges**
associated with it, and why the industry started moving toward microservices.

---

## 📦 What is a Monolith?

A **monolith** is a large, single-tiered software application where all
components are interconnected and interdependent.

> Imagine one huge application with:
>
> - A single codebase
> - One shared database
> - All features bundled into one deployable unit

In practice, this could mean **millions of lines of code** within one project,
maintained and deployed as a **single unit**.

---

## 🧱 Characteristics of a Monolith

- **Unified Codebase**: All features (like authentication, payments, product
  catalog, etc.) are in one place.
- **Single Build**: The application is compiled and deployed as one artifact
  (like a `.jar`, `.war`, or `.exe`).
- **Shared Database**: Usually, all modules use a single schema and data store.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges in Monolithic Applications

Let’s break down the **major pain points**:

### 1. 🚀 Deployment Complexity

- A small change in one module (e.g., fixing a typo) requires **redeploying the
  entire application**.
- No modular release or rollback strategy.

### 2. 🔗 Tightly Coupled Components

- Changes in one part can unexpectedly break another.
- Teams find it difficult to work in parallel.
- Integration tests become massive and error-prone.

### 3. 🕒 Long Release Cycles

> Why are release cycles longer?

- Because of tight coupling, any change needs full regression testing.
- Developers hesitate to make changes due to the **risk of breaking** unrelated
  features.
- Real-world scenario: releasing new versions can take **3–6 months**.

### 4. 📈 Scalability Limitations

Let’s visualize this with a simple diagram:

<!-- Use real generated image if needed -->

> Example:
>
> - Your application is a **movie app**.
> - Only the **customer service module** experiences heavy traffic.
> - With a monolith, you **cannot scale just that part**—you must scale the
>   **entire app**.
> - This leads to **waste of resources** and **higher costs**.

### 5. 🧱 Technology Lock-In

- You are tied to the tech stack chosen at the start.
- If the app is built in **Java**, you can’t easily add new features using
  **Python**, **Go**, or other modern languages.
- Adopting new technologies becomes difficult due to **tight
  interdependencies**.

## 📝 Summary

| Challenge             | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment Complexity | Entire app needs redeployment for even a small change             |
| Tight Coupling        | Components affect each other, hard to isolate failures            |
| Long Release Cycles   | Regression testing is mandatory for every change                  |
| Scalability Issues    | No independent scaling, all components must scale together        |
| Technology Lock-in    | Difficult to use new tech/languages due to one unified tech stack |

## ❓ Q&A: Important Questions and Answers

### ❓ What is a monolithic application?

**Answer**: A monolithic application is a single, unified software system where
all functionalities are bundled together and deployed as one unit.

---

### ❓ Why is deployment in a monolith difficult?

**Answer**: Even a small change requires redeploying the entire application,
which increases risk and effort.

---

### ❓ What does "tight coupling" mean in monoliths?

**Answer**: It means different parts of the application are heavily dependent on
each other. A change in one part can impact others.

---

### ❓ Can we scale parts of a monolith independently?

**Answer**: No. You must scale the **entire application**, even if only one part
needs more resources.

---

### ❓ What is technology lock-in in the context of monoliths?

**Answer**: You’re forced to stick to the tech stack originally chosen for the
app, making it hard to adopt newer technologies.

## 👣 What’s Next?

Now that you understand monoliths and their limitations, it's time to explore
**microservices**—a modern architecture built to overcome these exact problems.
