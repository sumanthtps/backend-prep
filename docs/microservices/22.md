title: "Connecting REST API to Database using Spring Data JPA"
sidebar_position: 22
---

In this step, we updated our hardcoded REST API to interact with a real
(in-memory) database using **Spring Data JPA** and **H2**. This involved
repository creation, method query derivation, integration with the controller,
and validation.

## üß© What We Did

### 1. **Created a JPA Repository Interface**

Spring Data JPA provides built-in implementation for most common database
operations.

```java
package com.example.currencyexchangeservice.repository;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import com.example.currencyexchangeservice.model.CurrencyExchange;

public interface CurrencyExchangeRepository extends JpaRepository<CurrencyExchange, Long> {
    CurrencyExchange findByFromAndTo(String from, String to);
}
```

- `CurrencyExchange` ‚Äì the entity being managed
- `Long` ‚Äì primary key type
- `findByFromAndTo(String from, String to)` ‚Äì custom query method generated
  automatically by Spring Data JPA

> Spring Data JPA understands method names and automatically creates queries.
> This is called **Query Derivation**.

---

### 2. **Injected Repository in Controller**

```java
@Autowired
private CurrencyExchangeRepository repository;
```

You can now use this repository to interact with the database. For example, you
can fetch all records with `repository.findAll()` or use the custom query:

```java
CurrencyExchange currencyExchange = repository.findByFromAndTo(from, to);
```

### 3. **Handled Absence of Data**

We added error handling in case the query returns no results:

```java
if (currencyExchange == null) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unable to find data for " + from + " to " + to);
}
```

---

## üìã Example: Controller Method

```java
@GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
public CurrencyExchange retrieveExchangeValue(@PathVariable String from, @PathVariable String to) {
    CurrencyExchange currencyExchange = repository.findByFromAndTo(from, to);
    if (currencyExchange == null) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Unable to find data for " + from + " to " + to);
    }
    currencyExchange.setEnvironment(environment.getProperty("local.server.port"));
    return currencyExchange;
}
```

This controller endpoint now returns dynamic data from the H2 in-memory database
instead of a hardcoded response.

## ‚ùó Missing Concepts Explained

### ‚úÖ What is `JpaRepository`?

`JpaRepository` is a Spring Data interface that provides JPA-related methods
like `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`, and delete operations without
implementing any logic.

### ‚úÖ What is Query Derivation?

Spring can derive queries from method names. For example,
`findByFromAndTo(String from, String to)` is auto-implemented using JPQL/HQL.

### ‚úÖ Why use `@Repository`?

Though not mandatory if you're extending `JpaRepository`, it helps with
exception translation. Spring catches `JPA` exceptions and converts them to
Spring's `DataAccessException` hierarchy.

### ‚úÖ Why use `@Autowired`?

Spring's dependency injection mechanism automatically provides the
implementation of `CurrencyExchangeRepository` at runtime.

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

### Q1: What does `findByFromAndTo` do?

It queries the database for a record where the `from` and `to` fields match the
given values.

### Q2: What if no data is found?

A `RuntimeException` is thrown with a descriptive message. You can later replace
this with a proper error response using `@ControllerAdvice`.

### Q3: Why not use native SQL here?

Spring Data JPA handles SQL generation for common cases, improving
maintainability and reducing boilerplate.

### Q4: How does Spring know how to implement this repository?

At runtime, Spring generates a proxy class that implements your interface using
JPA/Hibernate logic.
