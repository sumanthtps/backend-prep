title: "Client-Side Load Balancing using Feign and Eureka"

---

## Overview

In the previous step, we registered our microservices with Eureka. Now we‚Äôll
enable **client-side load balancing** between **multiple instances** of the
`currency-exchange-service` using **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** and **Feign**.

---

## Goals of This Step

- Enable dynamic resolution of service instances via Eureka
- Distribute load among instances using **Feign**
- Understand how Spring Cloud handles load balancing

---

## Before Load Balancing: Hardcoded URL in Feign Client

Originally, the Feign client in `currency-conversion-service` looked like this:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange", url = "http://localhost:8000")
public interface CurrencyExchangeProxy {
    @GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
    CurrencyExchange retrieveExchangeValue(@PathVariable String from, @PathVariable String to);
}
```

In this setup, every request goes to **port 8000**, regardless of how many
instances are running.

---

## Step 1: Enable Dynamic Service Lookup

Update your Feign client to rely on **service discovery** instead of a fixed
URL:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange")
public interface CurrencyExchangeProxy {
    @GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
    CurrencyExchange retrieveExchangeValue(@PathVariable String from, @PathVariable String to);
}
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Feign will now talk to **Eureka**, discover all registered
instances of `currency-exchange`, and load balance between them.

---

## Step 2: Launch Multiple Instances

Run two instances of `currency-exchange-service`:

- **First instance** on port `8000`
- **Second instance** on port `8001`

Use `application.properties` to set different ports:

```properties
server.port=8001
spring.application.name=currency-exchange
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

üöÄ Once both instances are up, Eureka will show:

| Application       | Status | Port |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---- |
| currency-exchange | UP     | 8000 |
| currency-exchange | UP     | 8001 |

---

## Step 3: Test Load Balancing in Browser

Call the currency conversion endpoint multiple times:

```
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
```

You‚Äôll see alternating responses from ports `8000` and `8001`, such as:

- Response from port **8000**
- Response from port **8001**
- Again from **8000**, and so on...

üîÅ This confirms that **load balancing is working** between instances.

---

## What Powers the Load Balancing?

### 1. Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

Spring Boot brings in the load balancer via transitive dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You don‚Äôt have to add it explicitly. It's brought in by:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Replacing Ribbon (Legacy)

Older Spring Cloud versions used **Netflix Ribbon** for client-side load
balancing. This is now deprecated and replaced by **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**.

---

## How It Works

The lifecycle of a request looks like this:

```text
FeignClient (currency-conversion)
    ‚áì
Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
    ‚áì
Eureka DiscoveryClient
    ‚áì
Select one of the active instances (8000 or 8001)
    ‚áì
Forward request to chosen instance
```

This is called **client-side load balancing**, where the logic of selecting an
instance is embedded inside the calling service.

---

## Recommended Practice

You can **start or stop instances dynamically**, and Eureka will:

- Remove instances when stopped (after a short delay)
- Re-discover instances when restarted
- Spring Cloud LoadBalancer will automatically adjust

üïí Wait 30‚Äì60 seconds for new/removed instances to be fully reflected.

---

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Do I need to write load balancing code manually?

**A:** No. Feign + Eureka + Spring Cloud LoadBalancer handle it automatically.

---

### Q2: What is the difference between Ribbon and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer?

**A:**

| Feature                  | Ribbon               | Spring Cloud LoadBalancer |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Status                   | Deprecated           | Actively maintained       |
| Configurable             | Yes                  | Yes                       |
| Netflix-based            | Yes                  | No                        |
| Built-in to Spring Cloud | Yes (older versions) | Yes (modern versions)     |

---

### Q3: What if one instance goes down?

**A:** Eureka removes it from registry (after heartbeat timeout), and
LoadBalancer avoids sending traffic to it.

---

### Q4: Is the load balancing round-robin?

**A:** Yes, by default. Spring Cloud LoadBalancer uses a **round-robin**
strategy, but you can customize it.

---

## Summary

- Removed the hardcoded URL from Feign client.
- Enabled client-side load balancing via Eureka.
- Launched multiple service instances and saw requests distributed among them.
- Understood the internal dependencies and behavior of Spring Cloud
  LoadBalancer.

Next, we‚Äôll explore how to use **Spring Cloud API Gateway** to centralize
routing and filtering.
