  "Service Discovery with Eureka Naming Server in Spring Boot Microservices"
sidebar_position: 27

## Overview

In a microservices architecture, hard-coding the URL of a service dependency
introduces tight coupling and makes the system less resilient and harder to
scale. To solve this, we use **Service Discovery**. In this tutorial, we
implement service discovery using **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**.

---

## Problem: Hardcoded Service URLs

In our current setup, the **Currency Conversion Service** uses a `RestTemplate`
to call the **Currency Exchange Service** using a hardcoded URL like:

```java
"http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR"
```

This creates several problems:

- If the service is moved to another port, code must be updated.
- If there are multiple instances (e.g., 8000, 8001, 8002), load balancing
  becomes manual.
- If an instance crashes and restarts on a new port, manual reconfiguration is
  needed.

### ❌ This violates the **12-Factor App** principles of _port binding_ and _config independence_.

---

## Solution: Service Registry (Naming Server)

To address these problems, we introduce a **Service Registry** or **Naming
Server**. All microservices register themselves with it, and services can
discover each other through it.

### 🔄 Interaction Flow

```
Currency Conversion Service → Service Registry → Currency Exchange Instances
```

### ✅ Benefits:

- Dynamic service discovery
- Load balancing support
- No hardcoded URLs

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Eureka Naming Server

### Step 1: Create the Project

Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and configure:

- **Project**: Maven
- **Language**: Java
- **Spring Boot version**: 2.5.0 (or latest stable)
- **Group**: `com.in28minutes.microservices`
- **Artifact**: `naming-server`
- **Dependencies**:

  - Spring Boot DevTools
  - Spring Boot Actuator
  - Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server

Then click **Generate**, unzip, and import it into your IDE.

---

## Step 2: Add Eureka Server Annotation

Open the main class: `NamingServerApplication.java`

```java
package com.in28minutes.microservices.namingserver;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer // Enables this application as Eureka Naming Server
public class NamingServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(NamingServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Annotation Explanation

- `@EnableEurekaServer`: Marks this Spring Boot application as a Eureka server
  that other microservices can register with.

---

## Step 3: Configure application.properties

Create or update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.application.name=naming-server
server.port=8761

# Prevent this server from registering itself with Eureka
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
```

### ⚙️ Properties Explained

| Property                             | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `spring.application.name`            | Logical name of the service                   |
| `server.port`                        | Port on which naming server runs              |
| `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` | Prevent Eureka Server from registering itself |
| `eureka.client.fetch-registry`       | Prevent fetching registry from itself         |

---

## Step 4: Run the Eureka Server

- Right-click `NamingServerApplication.java`
- Run as `Java Application`

Expected console log:

```
Started NamingServerApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

Open [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)

You should see the **Eureka Dashboard** like this:

> No instances are currently registered with Eureka.

This is expected since no client has registered yet. In the next steps, other
microservices will register with it.

---

## Missing Concept: What is Eureka?

**Eureka** is a REST-based service registry provided by Netflix and supported by
Spring Cloud. It has two main components:

1. **Eureka Server**: Hosts the registry of services.
2. **Eureka Client**: Registers itself with the server and queries for other
   services.

---

## Example: Registering a Microservice with Eureka

Add the dependency to another service (e.g., Currency Exchange Service):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Add `@EnableEurekaClient` (optional in newer versions) and update
`application.properties`:

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-exchange
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

Upon startup, this service will appear on the Eureka dashboard.

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Why not hardcode multiple URLs and round-robin manually?

**A:** This defeats the purpose of dynamic discovery. If services go down or
come up, you still need manual updates.

---

### Q2: What happens if Eureka server goes down?

**A:** Clients will use local cache temporarily but new registrations or
discovery won't work until the server is restored.

---

### Q3: Is Eureka client needed in the Naming Server?

**A:** No. We disable it using:

```properties
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
```

---

### Q4: Why use port 8761?

**A:** It's the conventional default for Eureka, similar to how 8080 is used for
web apps.

---

### Q5: What is Spring Boot Actuator used for?

**A:** It exposes endpoints like `/actuator/health` for monitoring. Eureka uses
these to check service health.

---

## Summary

- Hardcoding URLs leads to tightly coupled, brittle architecture.
- Eureka Naming Server solves this with dynamic service registration and
  discovery.
- We created a Eureka server using Spring Boot.
- Configured essential properties and ran the server on port 8761.
- Next, we'll register our microservices with Eureka for dynamic discovery and
  load balancing.

## Debugging Problems with Eureka - V3

- Debugging microservices problems can be difficult as there are multiple
  components involved.

### Step by Step instructions is provided in the troubleshooting guide to help you troubleshoot frequently occurring problems.

#### Using the Chrome Browser is recommended.

#### Top Recommendation From Debugging Guide:

Give these settings a try individually in application.properties of all
microservices (currency-exchange, currency-conversion) to see if they help

```properties
eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address=true
```

OR

```properties
eureka.instance.hostname=localhost
```
