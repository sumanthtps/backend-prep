title: Creating the Currency Exchange Microservice
sidebar_position: 18
---

## Overview

In this step, we focus on setting up the **Currency Exchange Microservice**
using Spring Boot. The service is created using
[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io), with the proper dependencies
configured for microservice behavior, externalized configuration, and REST API
capabilities. Additionally, we connect the service to Spring Cloud Config for
centralized configuration management.

---

## Detailed Explanation

### Project Setup with Spring Initializr

- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Language**: Java
- **Spring Boot Version**: Latest stable (or consistent with other services)
- **Group ID**: `com.in28minutes`
- **Artifact ID**: `currency-exchange-service`
- **Name**: `currency-exchange-service`

### Dependencies Chosen

| Dependency                 | Purpose                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spring Boot DevTools       | Enables automatic restarts during development                     |
| Spring Boot Actuator       | Exposes operational endpoints for monitoring                      |
| Spring Web                 | Required for building RESTful APIs                                |
| Spring Cloud Config Client | Allows this service to consume configuration from a config server |

### Configuration: `application.properties`

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-exchange
server.port=8000

spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

- **`spring.application.name`**: Used as the key to fetch external configuration
  from the Spring Cloud Config server.
- **`server.port`**: Runs this microservice on port 8000.
- **`spring.config.import`**: Points to a Config Server. `optional:` allows the
  service to start even if the server is not available.

### Import into Eclipse

- Extract the downloaded ZIP.
- Use `File → Import → Existing Maven Projects`.
- Select the extracted folder.
- Complete the import.

Once imported:

- Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties`
- Adjust the properties as mentioned above.

## Missing Concepts & Deep Dive

### 1. **Why Remove Config Server Dependency and Use Config Client?**

Using `spring-cloud-config-server` in a client application is incorrect and
leads to classpath conflicts. The **Config Server** should be a separate
standalone service. Your microservices should act as **Config Clients** and
fetch their configuration from the centralized Config Server.

### 2. **What is Spring Boot Actuator?**

Actuator provides endpoints like:

- `/actuator/health`: Check application health
- `/actuator/metrics`: Monitor app performance
- `/actuator/info`: Custom app info

You can customize these endpoints via `application.properties`.

### 3. **What is the Role of Spring Cloud Config?**

Centralizes configuration for multiple services, reducing duplication and
enabling dynamic refresh.

## Fully Explained Example

### Folder Structure After Generation

```
currency-exchange-service/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/in28minutes/currencyexchangeservice/
│   │   │       └── CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication.java
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       ├── application.properties
├── pom.xml
```

### Java Main Class

```java
package com.in28minutes.currencyexchangeservice;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This class:

- Bootstraps the application
- Enables component scanning
- Starts the embedded server on port 8000

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is the difference between Spring Cloud Config Server and Config Client?

**Answer**:

- **Config Server**: Central service that serves configuration from a Git repo
  or filesystem.
- **Config Client**: Microservices that fetch configuration from the server.

Including the `config-server` dependency in a client application causes it to
act like a server — which is incorrect.

---

### Q2. Why is Spring Boot Actuator important in microservices?

**Answer**: It provides **production-ready features** such as monitoring,
metrics, health checks, and more. These are useful for observability, service
discovery, and autoscaling.

---

### Q3. Why should we externalize the port and app name?

**Answer**: Externalizing properties like `server.port` and
`spring.application.name` helps:

- Run multiple services without port conflicts
- Organize centralized configuration
- Enable environment-based configurations (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`, etc.)

---

### Q4. How does `spring.config.import=optional:configserver:` work?

**Answer**: It tells Spring to:

- Attempt to connect to a config server
- But **not fail startup** if the server is down (`optional:` prefix)

---

## Summary

In this step:

- A new microservice called `currency-exchange-service` was created.
- Spring Initializr was used with appropriate dependencies for REST and
  configuration.
- The service was configured to connect to the Spring Cloud Config Server.
- We ensured best practices by removing incorrect dependencies.
- The app was successfully run on port 8000, ready for further development.
