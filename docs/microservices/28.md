title: "Registering Microservices with Eureka Naming Server"

## Overview

In the previous step, we set up a **Eureka Naming Server** for dynamic service
discovery. Now, we will **register two microservices**â€”the **Currency Exchange
Service** and **Currency Conversion Service**â€”with Eureka.

By doing this, each service becomes **discoverable** and can **communicate
without hardcoded URLs**.

---

## Goals of This Step

- Register `currency-exchange-service` with Eureka
- Register `currency-conversion-service` with Eureka
- Verify registration via Eureka dashboard

---

## Step-by-Step: Registering Microservices

### Step 1: Add Eureka Client Dependency

Open `pom.xml` of both microservices and add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

ðŸ“Œ **Note**: This is enough to make a Spring Boot app a Eureka client.

---

### Step 2: Configure `application.properties`

Although Eureka automatically connects to `localhost:8761`, it is a best
practice to **explicitly declare** the Eureka server URL.

#### For `currency-exchange-service`:

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-exchange
server.port=8000
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

#### For `currency-conversion-service`:

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-conversion
server.port=8100
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

ðŸ§  **Why declare `defaultZone` explicitly?**

Even though it's the default, setting this explicitly:

- Avoids ambiguity in multi-environment setups
- Makes it easier to reconfigure for production or cloud

---

## Step 3: Restart the Applications

After adding the dependencies and configuration, restart the services:

1. **Kill and relaunch `currency-exchange-service`**

   - It runs on port `8000`
   - Eureka should show: `currency-exchange` registered

2. **Kill and relaunch `currency-conversion-service`**

   - It runs on port `8100`
   - Eureka should show: `currency-conversion` registered

---

## Step 4: Verify on Eureka Dashboard

Open [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)

You should now see both services listed:

| Application Name    | Status | Port |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---- |
| currency-exchange   | UP     | 8000 |
| currency-conversion | UP     | 8100 |

ðŸ’¡ Eureka shows instance metadata like host, port, status, and instance ID.

---

## Internal Logs: Eureka Registration Status

Eureka logs will show lines like:

```bash
DiscoveryClient_CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange:8000: registering service...
DiscoveryClient_CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange:8000: registration complete.
```

When an instance shuts down:

```bash
DiscoveryClient_CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange:8000: de-registering service...
```

This proves that **Eureka tracks instance lifecycle events**: UP and DOWN.

---

## Missing Concept: Heartbeats and Self-Preservation

By default, each Eureka client sends a **heartbeat** every 30 seconds. If the
server doesnâ€™t receive heartbeats for a few intervals, it marks the instance as
DOWN.

**Self-preservation mode** (enabled by default) prevents Eureka from
aggressively removing instances during temporary network partitions.

---

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: What if we forget to add the Eureka client dependency?

**A:** The application will start, but it won't register with Eureka. You wonâ€™t
see it on the Eureka dashboard.

---

### Q2: Do we need to annotate the main class with `@EnableEurekaClient`?

**A:** It's optional in recent Spring Cloud versions (as long as the dependency
exists). Spring Boot auto-configures it.

---

### Q3: Can I register services on different hosts?

**A:** Yes. Just make sure they can reach the Eureka server over the network and
update `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone`.

---

### Q4: What happens if a registered service crashes?

**A:** Eureka will mark it as `DOWN` after missing a few heartbeats and
eventually remove it from the registry.

---

### Q5: Can a service register multiple instances?

**A:** Yes. For example, running multiple `currency-exchange-service` instances
on different ports will result in multiple entries in Eureka.

---

## Summary

- We registered two Spring Boot microservices with Eureka.
- Added the necessary dependency and configured Eureka server URL.
- Validated successful registration via the dashboard.
- Understood the heartbeat and instance lifecycle management of Eureka.

In the next step, weâ€™ll implement **load balancing** and dynamic communication
between services using **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Feign**.
