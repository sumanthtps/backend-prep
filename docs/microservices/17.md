# Overview of Currency Microservices

Before we dive into advanced topics like **API Gateway**, **Distributed
Tracing**, and **Circuit Breakers**, we need to set up two foundational
microservices:

- **Currency Exchange Microservice**
- **Currency Conversion Microservice**

These services will help demonstrate real-world interactions and
service-to-service communication.

## Currency Exchange Microservice

This microservice answers the question:

> "What is the exchange rate between two currencies?"

### Sample Endpoint

```
GET /currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 10001,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 65.0,
  "environment": "8000"
}
```

- `from` and `to` are the currency codes.
- `conversionMultiple` is the current exchange rate.
- `environment` indicates which server or instance processed the request.

## Currency Conversion Microservice

This service handles **actual currency conversion operations**, based on a
quantity and the exchange rate.

### Sample Endpoint

```
GET /currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 10001,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "quantity": 10,
  "conversionMultiple": 65.0,
  "totalCalculatedAmount": 650.0,
  "environment": "8100"
}
```

- It calls the Currency Exchange Microservice to get the rate (65.00 in this
  case).
- It calculates `totalCalculatedAmount = quantity * conversionMultiple`.

---

## Interaction Flow

```
Client Request
   |
   v
Currency Conversion Microservice
   |
   v
Currency Exchange Microservice (for rate lookup)
   |
   v
Returns Calculated Total to Client
```

This setup simulates **real inter-service calls**, and is used for demonstrating
fault-tolerance, scaling, routing, and observability patterns.

---

## Why These Microservices?

- **Simple business logic** helps us focus on technical patterns.
- Enables demonstration of Spring Cloud features such as:
  - Centralized config
  - Eureka service discovery
  - Load balancing
  - Distributed tracing with Zipkin
  - Circuit breaking with Resilience4j
  - Gateway routing

---

In the next step, we'll build the **Currency Exchange Microservice**.
