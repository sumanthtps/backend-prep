## Setting Up the Currency Conversion Microservice

In this step, we create a new Spring Boot microservice named **Currency
Conversion Service**. This service will be responsible for converting one
currency to another using exchange rates retrieved from another microservice â€”
the **Currency Exchange Service**.

We will configure the service from scratch using
[start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io), just like we did for the currency
exchange service.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Generate the Spring Boot Project

- Go to [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
- Select the following:
  - **Project**: Maven
  - **Language**: Java
  - **Spring Boot**: Latest stable version
- **Group**: `com.in28minutes.microservices` (or your preferred package)
- **Artifact**: `currency-conversion-service`

### 2. Add Required Dependencies

Choose the same dependencies used in the currency exchange service:

- **Spring Web**
- **Spring Boot DevTools**
- **Spring Boot Actuator**
- **Spring Cloud Config Client**

> ðŸ’¡ These dependencies are crucial for creating a REST API and enabling
> distributed configuration and monitoring support.

### 3. Extract & Import the Project

- Click **Generate**
- Unzip the project
- Import it into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse) as a **Maven project**
- Build should be quick since dependencies are already cached (if exchange
  service was recently built)

### 4. Set Application Properties

Update the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-conversion
server.port=8100

spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

You can copy the property file from `currency-exchange-service` and modify:

- `spring.application.name`
- `server.port`

> This setup assumes you're using a Spring Cloud Config Server running on
> port 8888.

## Missing Concepts Covered

### âœ… What is a Config Client?

The **Config Client** connects your microservice to a **Config Server**,
enabling externalized configuration. This is especially helpful for environments
like dev, test, and prod.

Without this, you'd have to maintain config values in each service individually.

### âœ… Why `@SpringBootApplication`?

Your main class uses this annotation:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class CurrencyConversionServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CurrencyConversionServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This annotation is a combination of:

- `@Configuration`: marks class as a source of bean definitions
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: enables auto-configuration
- `@ComponentScan`: scans for Spring components in the package

### âœ… Why Port 8100?

Each microservice must run on a different port. The suggested port range for
this service is `8100` onwards (e.g., 8100, 8101, etc.) to avoid conflicts.

## Fully Explained Code Example

### Main Application Class

```java
package com.in28minutes.microservices.currencyconversionservice;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CurrencyConversionServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CurrencyConversionServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### application.properties

```properties
spring.application.name=currency-conversion
server.port=8100
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

These settings:

- Identify the application to Spring Cloud Config Server
- Allow the application to retrieve shared configs
- Set a unique port for the service

## Frequently Asked Questions (Q\&A)

### Q1: What is the difference between the Currency Exchange and Conversion services?

**Currency Exchange Service** exposes endpoints to return exchange rates.

**Currency Conversion Service** consumes these endpoints and applies logic to
convert one currency into another using the exchange rate.

---

### Q2: Why do we use `spring.config.import` instead of the older `spring.cloud.config.uri`?

`spring.config.import` is a **Spring Boot 2.4+** feature that replaces the older
way of specifying external configs. Itâ€™s the new recommended way to import
configuration from a remote config server.

---

### Q3: What is the role of the Actuator?

Spring Boot Actuator exposes operational information about your service (e.g.,
health, metrics, environment, etc.) via HTTP endpoints.

Useful endpoints:

- `/actuator/health`
- `/actuator/info`
- `/actuator/beans`

---

### Q4: Can I run this service without a Config Server?

Yes, if you comment out the `spring.config.import` line. But you'll lose
centralized config benefits.

---

### Q5: Whatâ€™s next after setting this up?

Once the Currency Conversion service is running, you can implement an endpoint
(e.g., `/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10`) that:

1. Calls the Currency Exchange service
2. Applies conversion logic
3. Returns a combined response

---

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully set up the **Currency Conversion Microservice**, including:

- Bootstrapping with Spring Initializr
- Adding required dependencies
- Connecting to Spring Cloud Config Server
- Configuring ports and application names
