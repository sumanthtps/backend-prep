# 🧰 Key Solutions for Microservices Architecture

Implementing microservices comes with a unique set of challenges—**service
discovery**, **configuration management**, **deployment consistency**, and more.

In this step, we’ll explore the **key tools and frameworks** that help solve
these challenges, especially focusing on the **Spring ecosystem**, **Docker**,
and **Kubernetes**.

## ☕ 1. Spring Boot — Rapid REST API Development

Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the setup and development of
**Spring-based applications**.

### ✅ Benefits:

- Rapid development of REST APIs
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- Auto-configuration and starter dependencies
- Easy to run with `java -jar`

### 🧪 Example: REST API with Spring Boot

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/movies")
public class MovieController {

    @GetMapping
    public List<Movie> getAllMovies() {
        return List.of(new Movie("Inception"), new Movie("Interstellar"));
    }
}
```

Spring Boot makes this minimal and production-ready without needing to configure
XML or setup extensive boilerplate.

## ☁️ 2. Spring Cloud — Distributed Microservices Toolkit

Spring Cloud is a **collection of sub-projects** that address the core concerns
in microservice architectures.

### 🔧 Key Features:

---

### 🛠️ a. Centralized Configuration — _Spring Cloud Config Server_

Helps manage configuration for multiple services and environments from a central
Git repository.

### 📁 Example Git Repo Structure:

```
/config-repo/
├── booking-service-dev.yml
├── booking-service-prod.yml
├── customer-service-dev.yml
```

Each microservice reads its config from this repo.

---

### ⚖️ b. Load Balancing — _Spring Cloud LoadBalancer_

Distributes traffic across active service instances.

### 🧪 Example:

If `booking-service` has 5 instances, requests will be automatically distributed
among them using round-robin or custom logic.

---

### 🔍 c. Service Discovery — _Eureka Naming Server_

Avoids hardcoding service URLs. Services register with Eureka, and others query
for them.

### 📦 Example Flow:

```plaintext
[Booking Service] —> [Eureka] —> [Customer Service Instance Address]
```

Spring Cloud provides client-side integration with Eureka via
`@EnableEurekaClient`.

---

### 📡 d. Distributed Tracing — _Zipkin, Sleuth Integration_

When a request passes through multiple services, **tracing** helps pinpoint
where errors occur.

Spring Cloud Sleuth adds unique trace IDs to log entries.

```plaintext
[TraceID: 123abc] Calling Booking Service
[TraceID: 123abc] Calling Pricing Service
```

These logs are correlated and visualized using **Zipkin** or **Jaeger**.

---

### 🌐 e. Edge Server — _Spring Cloud Gateway_

Acts as the **API Gateway** for all microservices.

### ✨ Benefits:

- Central authentication
- Routing and filtering
- Rate limiting

### 🧪 Example Route Config (YAML):

```yaml
routes:
  - id: movie-service
    uri: http://localhost:8081
    predicates:
      - Path=/movies/**
```

---

### 🔁 f. Fault Tolerance — _Resilience4j Integration_

Protects against cascading failures using:

- Circuit breakers
- Retries
- Rate limiters

### Example with `@CircuitBreaker`:

```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "bookingService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackBook")
public String bookTickets() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://booking-service/book", String.class);
}
```

---

## 📦 3. Docker — Consistent Deployment

Docker enables you to package microservices with all dependencies into
containers.

### 🧪 Example `Dockerfile` for Spring Boot:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/app.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

Once built, the image can run **anywhere**—local, QA, or production—regardless
of environment or programming language.

---

## ☸️ 4. Kubernetes — Microservice Orchestration

Kubernetes (K8s) automates deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized
services.

### 🔧 Key Features:

- **Load balancing**
- **Service discovery**
- **Rolling updates**
- **Self-healing pods**

### 🧪 Example Deployment YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: movie-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: movie-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: movie-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: movie-service
          image: movie-service:1.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```
