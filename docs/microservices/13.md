# Debugging Spring Cloud Config Server - V3

Debugging microservices is often challenging due to the number of moving parts
and dependencies between services. If something goes wrong with your **Spring
Cloud Config Server**, follow the structured troubleshooting steps below.

---

## Use Chrome Browser

While debugging the Config Server or hitting endpoints manually, using **Google
Chrome** is recommended for clearer response formatting and easier debugging via
dev tools.

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

The in28Minutes GitHub repository provides detailed step-by-step guidance:

**Reference:**
[Spring Cloud Config Server - Steps 01 to 08](https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-microservices-v3/blob/main/03.microservices/01-step-by-step-changes/readme.md#spring-cloud-config-server---steps-01-to-08)

This guide covers:

- Common configuration issues
- Git repo connection problems
- Server startup errors
- Application property retrieval issues

---

## General Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Git Repo Path**

   - Ensure no spaces in the Git repo path.
   - Verify the repo has at least one committed file.

2. **Validate Config Server Port**

   - Ensure it is running on `8888` as per convention.
   - Check `server.port` in `application.properties`.

3. **Verify `@EnableConfigServer` is Present**

   - This annotation is required in your main class to activate Config Server
     functionality.

4. **Access the Endpoint Directly** Try accessing your config endpoint in
   Chrome:

   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:8888/limits-service/default
   ```

   If this fails:

   - Check the Git repo URL in your Config Server's `application.properties`
   - Ensure file naming conventions (e.g., `limits-service.properties`) are
     correct

5. **Enable Debug Logging** Add this to `application.properties` if you need
   more insight:

   ```properties
   logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
   ```

## Summary

Troubleshooting Spring Cloud Config Server requires verifying several
interconnected parts:

- Git repository correctness
- Correct Spring annotations
- Proper file paths and service naming
- Server port settings and endpoint responses

Use the linked guide and Chrome browser for effective step-by-step debugging.
