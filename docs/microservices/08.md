# Creating the Limits REST Controller

In this step, we'll build a simple **REST API** in the `limits-service`
microservice. We'll start with hardcoded values and later integrate it with
**application configuration** and then with the **Spring Cloud Config Server**.

---

## Step 1: Verify Project Import

Ensure the Maven project is successfully imported into Eclipse or your IDE of
choice. If the import is taking a long time, make sure:

- You're using the **latest Eclipse for Enterprise Java Developers**
- You have a stable internet connection (to download dependencies)

---

## Step 2: Launch the Spring Boot App

In your IDE, right-click the main class:

```java
LimitsServiceApplication.java
```

Select:

```
Run As > Java Application
```

Confirm the application starts without errors on port `8080`.

---

## Step 3: Create the Controller Package

Create a new package under the same base package as `LimitsServiceApplication`.

```plaintext
com.in28minutes.microservices.limitsservice.controller
```

Then create a new class:

```java
@RestController
public class LimitsController {

    @GetMapping("/limits")
    public Limits retrieveLimits() {
        return new Limits(1, 1000);
    }
}
```

Add the appropriate imports for `@RestController` and `@GetMapping`.

---

## Step 4: Create the `Limits` Bean

Create a new package:

```plaintext
com.in28minutes.microservices.limitsservice.bean
```

Then create a class `Limits`:

```java
public class Limits {

    private int minimum;
    private int maximum;

    public Limits() {
    }

    public Limits(int minimum, int maximum) {
        this.minimum = minimum;
        this.maximum = maximum;
    }

    public int getMinimum() {
        return minimum;
    }

    public void setMinimum(int minimum) {
        this.minimum = minimum;
    }

    public int getMaximum() {
        return maximum;
    }

    public void setMaximum(int maximum) {
        this.maximum = maximum;
    }
}
```

This is a standard JavaBean with:

- Private fields
- Getters and setters
- Parameterized constructor
- No-arg constructor (required by Spring for deserialization)

---

## Step 5: Run and Test

Re-run the application. Navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/limits
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "minimum": 1,
  "maximum": 1000
}
```

---

## Step 6: Component Scanning Best Practices

Ensure that:

- All your controllers, services, and beans are under **sub-packages** of
  `com.in28minutes.microservices.limitsservice`
- This allows Spring Boot to discover and wire them using component scanning

If you place classes outside of the main package, Spring will not detect them
unless you manually configure `@ComponentScan`.

## Summary

| Task                      | Outcome                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Created REST Controller   | `LimitsController` under `/limits` route       |
| Created JavaBean          | `Limits` with fields `minimum` and `maximum`   |
| Verified API is working   | Returns static JSON at `localhost:8080/limits` |
| Ensured correct structure | Classes are in sub-packages for discovery      |

## Q&A

### Why is package structure important in Spring Boot?

**Answer**: Spring Boot scans for components from the package where the main
class is located. Sub-packages are included by default.

---

### Why did we use hardcoded values?

**Answer**: It's a first step to validate the API works before integrating with
external config sources.

---

### What if `/limits` returns a 404?

**Answer**: Ensure the controller is in a sub-package of the main application
class and has `@RestController` properly imported.
