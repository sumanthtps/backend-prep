title: Building a REST API for Currency Exchange
sidebar_position: 19
---

## Overview

In this step, we build the core REST API for the **Currency Exchange Service**.
This API exposes exchange rate information between two currencies using a simple
URL format like:
```
GET /currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
```

We create a `CurrencyExchangeController`, a `CurrencyExchange` bean, and return hardcoded data as a starting point. This setup forms the foundation of a real microservice in the Spring Boot ecosystem.

---

## Detailed Explanation

### REST Endpoint Specification

The goal is to create a GET endpoint:

```
GET /currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}
```

Which returns exchange rate details for converting one currency to another.

### Controller Implementation

We define a `@RestController` with a `@GetMapping` to handle dynamic path variables.

```java
@RestController
public class CurrencyExchangeController {

    @GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
    public CurrencyExchange retrieveExchangeValue(
            @PathVariable String from,
            @PathVariable String to) {

        return new CurrencyExchange(1000L, from, to, BigDecimal.valueOf(50));
    }
}
```

- **@RestController**: Marks the class as a RESTful controller.
- **@GetMapping**: Maps HTTP GET requests to the handler method.
- **@PathVariable**: Extracts dynamic values from the URI.
- The controller returns a hardcoded `CurrencyExchange` object.

### Domain Model: `CurrencyExchange` Bean

```java
public class CurrencyExchange {

    private Long id;
    private String from;
    private String to;
    private BigDecimal conversionMultiple;

    public CurrencyExchange() {
    }

    public CurrencyExchange(Long id, String from, String to, BigDecimal conversionMultiple) {
        this.id = id;
        this.from = from;
        this.to = to;
        this.conversionMultiple = conversionMultiple;
    }

    // Getters and setters for all fields
}
```

- **BigDecimal** is used to avoid floating-point precision issues with currency.
- Includes:

  - No-arg constructor (needed for serialization and later JPA)
  - All-arg constructor
  - Getters and setters

### Example Output (JSON)

```json
{
  "id": 1000,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 50
}
```

This output is automatically serialized from the `CurrencyExchange` object by
Spring Boot’s Jackson integration.

## Missing Concepts & Deep Dive

### 1. Why Use `@PathVariable`?

`@PathVariable` allows us to create dynamic endpoints:

```java
@GetMapping("/item/{id}")
public Item getItem(@PathVariable int id)
```

Instead of hardcoded query params, this allows URLs to be cleaner and RESTful.

---

### 2. Why Use `BigDecimal` Over `double` for Currency?

Using `double` introduces floating-point rounding errors. `BigDecimal` allows
high precision arithmetic, which is necessary in domains like banking and
currency.

```java
BigDecimal value = BigDecimal.valueOf(50);
```

---

### 3. Why Include a No-Argument Constructor?

Frameworks like Spring and JPA often use **reflection** to create objects. They
require a **no-argument constructor** to initialize beans and entities.

---

### 4. When Should We Move Components to Separate Packages?

Although everything was created in the same package here, best practices
recommend:

- `controller/`: For REST controllers
- `model/`: For domain objects like `CurrencyExchange`
- `repository/`: For JPA or data layer
- `service/`: For business logic

This improves maintainability and organization in larger projects.

## Fully Explained Example

### Project Structure (Current)

```
src/main/java/com/in28minutes/currencyexchangeservice/
├── CurrencyExchangeController.java
├── CurrencyExchange.java
```

### Run the Application

Ensure the service is configured to run on port `8000`:

```properties
# application.properties
server.port=8000
```

Access the API via:

```
http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
```

Expected Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1000,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 50
}
```

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is the difference between `@PathVariable` and `@RequestParam`?

**Answer:**

- `@PathVariable` extracts values from the **URI path**.
- `@RequestParam` extracts values from the **query string**.

Example:

- `/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR` → `@PathVariable`
- `/currency-exchange?from=USD&to=INR` → `@RequestParam`

---

### Q2. Why is `BigDecimal` preferred for financial calculations?

**Answer:**

`BigDecimal` avoids rounding issues with floating-point numbers
(`float`/`double`). It’s immutable and precise, ideal for monetary values.

---

### Q3. What is the role of `@RestController` in Spring Boot?

**Answer:**

`@RestController` is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It
tells Spring to return JSON/XML directly from the controller methods instead of
rendering a view.

---

### Q4. How does Spring Boot convert a Java object to JSON?

**Answer:**

Spring Boot uses Jackson (by default) to serialize Java objects (POJOs) into
JSON. The returned object from a `@RestController` method is automatically
converted into JSON and sent in the HTTP response.

---

## Summary

In this step, we:

- Created a REST endpoint to fetch currency exchange values.
- Used `@PathVariable` for dynamic URLs.
- Built a domain object `CurrencyExchange`.
- Returned hardcoded data to validate the controller.
- Learned about BigDecimal precision, Jackson serialization, and RESTful
  practices.

This foundation sets up further enhancements like database integration, service
discovery, and communication between microservices.
