# Standardization of Ports

In a microservices architecture, **consistent and conflict-free port
management** is essential to ensure smooth local development, testing, and
deployment.

Below are the standardized ports we will be using for different microservices
and supporting components throughout this course. It's recommended to **keep
this reference handy**.

## Microservice Port Conventions

| Component                            | Assigned Port(s)             |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Limits Microservice**              | `8080`, `8081`, etc.         |
| **Spring Cloud Config Server**       | `8888`                       |
| **Currency Exchange Microservice**   | `8000`, `8001`, `8002`, etc. |
| **Currency Conversion Microservice** | `8100`, `8101`, `8102`, etc. |
| **Netflix Eureka Naming Server**     | `8761`                       |
| **API Gateway**                      | `8765`                       |
| **Zipkin Tracing Server**            | `9411`                       |

## Why Standardize Ports?

In a distributed system:

- Predictable ports make services easier to discover, debug, and configure.
- Avoids **port conflicts** between services and tools.
- Simplifies **scripts**, **Docker setups**, and **Kubernetes configurations**.
- Enables seamless **CI/CD integration** and **environment promotion**.

---

## Best Practices

- Assign unique ports for **each instance** of a microservice if running locally
  in parallel.
- Keep **configuration files** (e.g., `application.properties`) up to date with
  correct port bindings.
- If using Docker, expose and map these ports explicitly to avoid runtime
  conflicts.
- Use `server.port` in `application.properties` to bind each service to its
  designated port:

```properties
server.port=8000
```

---

## Summary

Adhering to this port standard allows:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Simplified service discovery
- Efficient local development and integration testing

Keep these assignments consistent across all environments unless there's a
specific override needed for deployment platforms.
