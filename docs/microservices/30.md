## Overview

In the last few steps, we created two microservices:

- `currency-conversion-service`
- `currency-exchange-service`

In this step, we tackle one of the common challenges in microservices:
**handling cross-cutting concerns** like authentication, logging, monitoring,
and rate limiting across all services without duplicating code in each service.

---

## Why an API Gateway?

When we have many microservices, it's inefficient to duplicate shared logic
like:

- Authentication and authorization
- Logging and metrics collection
- Request rate limiting
- CORS handling

ðŸ”‘ Instead, we use an **API Gateway** to handle these concerns **once**, and
**route all traffic through it** before it reaches a microservice.

---

## Architecture with API Gateway

Hereâ€™s how communication flows with a gateway:

```

Client â‡“ API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) â‡“ currency-conversion-service â‡“
currency-exchange-service

```

Every request from client â†’ goes through the **API Gateway**, which then
forwards it to the right service.

---

## Setting Up the API Gateway

### Project Setup

Using [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io), create a new Spring
Boot project:

- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Spring Boot Version**: Latest stable
- **Artifact**: `api-gateway`

### Dependencies

Select the following:

- `Spring Boot DevTools`
- `Spring Boot Actuator`
- `Eureka Discovery Client`
- `Spring Cloud Gateway` (search for **Reactive Gateway**)

```xml
<!-- Example Maven dependencies -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Generate and import the project into Eclipse or your IDE.

---

## Configure `application.properties`

```properties
spring.application.name=api-gateway
server.port=8765

eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

### Launch Gateway

Right-click â†’ Run as Java Application â†’ Confirm it starts on port `8765`.

---

## What is Spring Cloud Gateway?

Spring Cloud Gateway is the **modern and recommended API Gateway** in the Spring
Cloud ecosystem. It is a **reactive, non-blocking** API gateway built on top of
**Spring WebFlux**.

### Why not Zuul?

`Zuul` (Netflix's previous gateway) is now deprecated. `Spring Cloud Gateway` is
its official replacement.

## Key Features of Spring Cloud Gateway

| Feature                     | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Routing**                 | Forward requests to services based on path, header, method, etc.   |
| **Filters**                 | Intercept and modify requests/responses (e.g., logging, auth)      |
| **Predicates**              | Match incoming requests using conditions                           |
| **Path Rewriting**          | Change request path before forwarding                              |
| **Discovery Integration**   | Works with Eureka to discover and load balance to active instances |
| **Reactive & Non-blocking** | Built on **Spring WebFlux** for better performance                 |

---

## Concepts: Predicates and Filters

- **Predicates**: Define **when** to route a request (e.g., path starts with
  `/currency-exchange/**`)
- **Filters**: Define **what** to do before/after routing (e.g., add header, log
  time)

### Example Use Cases

- Add custom header to all responses
- Block requests without authorization header
- Route `/currency-conversion/**` to the `currency-conversion-service`

---

## Example Architecture with API Gateway

```
       +--------------------------+
       |  Spring Cloud Gateway   |
       | (localhost:8765)        |
       +-----------+--------------+
                   |
    +--------------+--------------+
    |                             |
currency-conversion      currency-exchange
   (port: 8100)              (port: 8000, 8001)
```

The gateway dynamically discovers services from Eureka and routes requests
accordingly.

---

## Summary

- API Gateway centralizes cross-cutting concerns.
- Spring Cloud Gateway is the modern gateway solution built on Spring WebFlux.
- Weâ€™ve set up the gateway with required dependencies and verified it launches
  correctly.
- In the next steps, weâ€™ll configure the routes and filters to enable request
  routing.

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Why not just call microservices directly?

**A:** Direct communication leads to duplicated logic like auth/logging in every
service. An API gateway centralizes this, making architecture cleaner and more
manageable.

---

### Q2: What is the difference between a predicate and a filter?

| Predicate                             | Filter                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Decides if a request should be routed | Modifies request/response     |
| Example: Path = `/api/**`             | Example: Add header, log time |

---

### Q3: Is Spring Cloud Gateway production-ready?

**A:** Yes, itâ€™s production-ready and widely used in Spring Cloud-based
microservices.

---

### Q4: Can the gateway do load balancing?

**A:** Yes. It integrates with **Eureka Discovery Client**, detects all service
instances, and load balances between them automatically.

---

Next, we will configure actual routes in `application.yml` or Java Config to
define how requests are routed from the API Gateway to target services.
