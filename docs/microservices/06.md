# 🗂️ Centralized Configuration in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, **configuration management becomes complex** due to the sheer number of services, environments, and deployment targets.

Let’s explore why centralized configuration is necessary and how **Spring Cloud Config Server** helps solve this problem.

---

## 🧾 Why Centralized Configuration?

Every application needs external configurations like:

- 🌐 URLs for external services
- 🛢️ Database connection strings
- ✉️ Queue or messaging server details
- ⚙️ Custom business-related properties

---

### ❗ The Problem in Microservices

In a monolithic application, managing configuration is **simple**—everything resides in a single place.

However, with microservices:

- You may have **dozens or hundreds of services**
- Each service might run in **multiple environments** (dev, test, prod)
- You could have **multiple instances** of each service per environment

📉 Without centralized config:
- Changes must be replicated across service repositories
- It’s easy to have inconsistencies
- Manual updates increase risk of misconfiguration

---

## ☁️ Spring Cloud Config Server

Spring Cloud Config Server allows us to store all configurations in a **central Git repository**, from where every microservice can retrieve its configuration.

### 🔧 Benefits:
- Centralized management of properties
- Environment-specific profiles (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)
- Versioned and auditable via Git
- Live refresh with Spring Actuator

---

## 🧪 Example Setup: Centralized Config with Limits Microservice

We’ll use a simple microservice called `limits-service` as an example.

---

### 📁 Step 1: Setup Git Configuration Repository

Create a folder like:

```

/config-repo/
├── limits-service.properties
├── limits-service-dev.properties
├── limits-service-prod.properties

````

**Example: `limits-service.properties`**

```properties
limits.minimum=5
limits.maximum=999
````

Commit this folder to a Git repository (local or GitHub).

---

### ☁️ Step 2: Spring Cloud Config Server Setup

Create a Spring Boot application with the `spring-cloud-config-server` dependency.

**Add ************`@EnableConfigServer`************ in the main class:**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConfigServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**`application.yml`**\*\* for the Config Server:\*\*

```yaml
server:
  port: 8888

spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/your-org/config-repo
```

---

### 🔌 Step 3: Connect Client Microservice to Config Server

In the `limits-service`, add the following to `bootstrap.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: limits-service

  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
```

This tells the `limits-service` to fetch its configuration from the central config server.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Access the Configuration

\*\*Example: \*\***`LimitsConfiguration.java`**

```java
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties("limits")
public class LimitsConfiguration {
    private int minimum;
    private int maximum;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Example: Using it in a Controller**

```java
@RestController
public class LimitsController {

    private final LimitsConfiguration config;

    public LimitsController(LimitsConfiguration config) {
        this.config = config;
    }

    @GetMapping("/limits")
    public LimitsConfiguration retrieveLimits() {
        return config;
    }
}
```

When `/limits` is called, it returns values fetched from the **Git-based central config**.

## ✅ Summary

| Challenge                             | Centralized Config Solution                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Inconsistent settings across services | Git-managed config repo                           |
| Environment-specific configurations   | Profile-based property files                      |
| Repetitive manual changes             | Single update propagates via Config Server        |
| Risky deployments due to config       | Version-controlled and refreshable configurations |

## ❓ Q&A

### ❓ Why can't each microservice manage its own config?

**Answer**: It leads to duplication, risk of inconsistencies, and painful multi-env updates across hundreds of services.

---

### ❓ Where are configuration files stored in this setup?

**Answer**: In a **central Git repository**, managed as text files like `.properties` or `.yml`.

---

### ❓ What happens when I update config in the Git repo?

**Answer**: You can trigger a **/actuator/refresh** on the client or use **Spring Cloud Bus** to auto-refresh configurations.

---

### ❓ Can different environments have separate configs?

**Answer**: Yes. You can define `limits-service-dev.properties`, `limits-service-prod.properties`, etc., and Spring Cloud will load them based on the active profile.
