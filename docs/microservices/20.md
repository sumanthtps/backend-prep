title: Add Environment Info to Currency Exchange Service
sidebar_position: 20
---

## Overview

In this step, we enhance the **Currency Exchange Service** to return
**environment-specific information**, such as the port number the current
instance is running on. This is a key feature in microservice environments with
multiple instances behind a load balancer or service discovery server.

---

## Problem Statement

When multiple instances of a microservice are running (e.g., on ports `8000`,
`8001`, `8002`), we want to know **which instance** handled the request. This
helps in debugging, verifying load balancing, and tracking traffic distribution.

---

## Enhancing the Domain Object

We modify the `CurrencyExchange` class to include an additional field:

```java
private String environment;
```

### Generate Getters/Setters

We do **not** add this field to the constructor. Instead, we generate
`getEnvironment()` and `setEnvironment()` methods.

This ensures that the field can be populated **dynamically** from the controller
based on runtime configuration.

---

## Update Controller to Set Environment

### Inject Spring's `Environment`

```java
@Autowired
private Environment environment;
```

Make sure to import:

```java
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;
```

### Set the Port in Response

Modify the controller method to populate the environment info:

```java
@GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
public CurrencyExchange retrieveExchangeValue(
        @PathVariable String from,
        @PathVariable String to) {

    CurrencyExchange currencyExchange =
        new CurrencyExchange(1000L, from, to, BigDecimal.valueOf(50));

    String port = environment.getProperty("local.server.port");
    currencyExchange.setEnvironment(port);

    return currencyExchange;
}
```

This uses:

```java
environment.getProperty("local.server.port")
```

To dynamically fetch the actual port used at runtime.

---

## Running Multiple Instances

We now run **two instances** of the same Spring Boot application on different
ports.

### Step 1: Default Instance

Runs on port `8000` (defined in `application.properties`).

```properties
server.port=8000
```

### Step 2: Duplicate Run Configuration for Port 8001

In your IDE:

- Open **Run Configurations**
- Duplicate `CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication`
- In the new config, under **VM Arguments**, add:

```
-Dserver.port=8001
```

This overrides the default port value.

### Start Both Instances

- One runs on `localhost:8000`
- The other runs on `localhost:8001`

---

## Test the Endpoint

Use a browser or REST client to call:

```
http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
```

```json
{
  "id": 1000,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 50,
  "environment": "8000"
}
```

Then call:

```
http://localhost:8001/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
```

```json
{
  "id": 1000,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 50,
  "environment": "8001"
}
```

This proves that each instance includes its own port number, which helps in
verifying **instance identity** in load-balanced environments.

## Missing Concepts & Deep Dive

### 1. Why Use `Environment` from Spring?

Spring Boot allows injecting the `Environment` object to access properties at
runtime. It's useful for:

- Reading port numbers
- Accessing custom environment variables
- Supporting multiple runtime profiles

---

### 2. Override `application.properties` with Command Line

The command-line argument:

```
-Dserver.port=8001
```

Overrides the `application.properties` file. Spring Boot’s property resolution
hierarchy is:

1. Command-line args (`-D`)
2. Environment variables
3. `application.properties`
4. Default values

---

### 3. Why Not Add Environment to Constructor?

The environment info is **runtime-dependent**. Constructors are typically used
to initialize **core domain fields**, while dynamic or context-specific fields
are better set via setters.

---

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is the use of Spring’s `Environment` class?

**Answer:**

`Environment` provides access to properties in the current Spring
`ApplicationContext`. It allows runtime retrieval of configuration values such
as `server.port`.

---

### Q2. How can we run multiple instances of the same Spring Boot application?

**Answer:**

- Use different port numbers via:

  - `application.properties`
  - `-Dserver.port=XXXX`

- Launch instances with different configurations.

---

### Q3. Why include port in the response of a microservice?

**Answer:**

- Helps in identifying which instance served the request.
- Useful in debugging and verifying load balancer behavior.
- Aids in monitoring traffic distribution.

---

## Summary

- Added an `environment` field to the `CurrencyExchange` class.
- Used Spring's `Environment` object to fetch the current port.
- Set up multiple instances of the service on ports `8000` and `8001`.
- Validated the environment field through actual service responses.

This is a **microservice-friendly enhancement** that improves visibility and
traceability in distributed systems.
