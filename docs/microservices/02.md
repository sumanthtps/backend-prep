# üß© What is a Microservice?

After understanding the challenges of monolithic applications, the natural
evolution in modern software architecture is toward **microservices**.

However, defining microservices is **not as straightforward** as you might
expect.

---

## üßæ Varying Definitions of Microservices

There are **multiple definitions** of microservices depending on the
perspective‚Äîdeveloper, architect, or organization. Two well-known definitions
include:

### üîπ Sam Newman (Author of _Building Microservices_)

> **"Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together."**

Short and intuitive: focus on _autonomy_ and _collaboration_.

---

### üîπ James Lewis & Martin Fowler

> **"The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single
> application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and
> communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These
> services are built around business capabilities and are independently
> deployable by fully automated deployment machinery."**

- Encourages **business-driven design**
- Emphasizes **independent deployment**
- Promotes **REST communication**, lightweight APIs
- Enables **language and database heterogeneity**

## üß† Simplifying Microservices: 3 Key Focus Areas

To make microservices easier to grasp, here are the **three most critical
principles**:

---

### 1. üåê REST-Based Communication

Microservices should communicate using **lightweight protocols**‚Äîtypically
**RESTful APIs**.

- Stateless communication
- HTTP-based interaction (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Well-defined endpoints for each service

> REST brings **simplicity**, **scalability**, and **standardization**.

---

### 2. üß± Small, Well-Chosen, Independently Deployable Units

Each microservice:

- Focuses on a **specific business capability**
- Has **clearly defined boundaries**
- Can be **developed, deployed, and scaled independently**

> Example:
>
> - Microservice A ‚Üí User Management
> - Microservice B ‚Üí Billing
> - Microservice C ‚Üí Notifications

> Deployment of Microservice B should **not impact** A or C.

### 3. üìà Dynamic Scaling

Each microservice should support **independent and dynamic scaling** based on
load.

- If Microservice C experiences high traffic, scale up its instances
- If Microservice A has low traffic, scale down its instances
- Achievable with orchestrators like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, or
  **ECS**

> This allows optimal **resource utilization** and better **cost efficiency**.

## üìù Summary

| Principle                | Description                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| REST-Based Communication | Services communicate via lightweight HTTP REST APIs    |
| Small, Deployable Units  | Independently built, deployed, and maintained services |
| Dynamic Scaling          | Services scale independently based on real-time demand |

## ‚ùì Q&A: Understanding Microservices

### ‚ùì What is the simplest definition of a microservice?

**Answer**: A small, autonomous service that performs a specific business
function and communicates with others over a lightweight API.

---

### ‚ùì How is REST important for microservices?

**Answer**: REST enables services to communicate in a stateless, standardized
way using HTTP, promoting interoperability and scalability.

---

### ‚ùì Why is independent deployability critical?

**Answer**: It allows teams to release, roll back, or update one service without
impacting others, speeding up development and reducing risk.

---

### ‚ùì What is dynamic scaling in microservices?

**Answer**: The ability to increase or decrease the number of instances of a
microservice based on incoming traffic or system load.

---

### ‚ùì Can microservices be written in different programming languages?

**Answer**: Yes. One of the strengths of microservices is **polyglot
programming**‚Äîeach service can use the language and database best suited to its
needs.

Now that you know what microservices are, let‚Äôs go deeper into how microservices
solve monolith challenges with **real-world examples**, **best practices**, and
**deployment strategies**.
