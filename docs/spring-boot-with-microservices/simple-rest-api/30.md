title: Connecting REST API to Database with JPA and Hibernate
id: jpa-hibernate-integration
sidebar_label: Connect to Database
---

In this section, we’ll connect our Spring Boot REST API to a database using
**JPA (Java Persistence API)** and **Hibernate**.

---

## 🏗️ Goal

Upgrade our current `UserResource` to interact with a real database rather than
a static list.

---

## 🧱 Current Architecture

Currently, `UserResource` interacts with `UserDaoService`, which returns users
from a hardcoded static list.

### We will:

- Replace `UserDaoService` with a `UserRepository`
- Use **JPA and Hibernate** to persist data in an **H2 in-memory database**

---

## ⚙️ Dependencies Already Included

When we created our Spring Boot project, we included:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

✅ So no need to add them again!

---

## 🔄 What's Next?

In the upcoming steps, we will:

1. Create a `User` JPA entity.
2. Set up `UserRepository` interface.
3. Update `UserResource` to use the repository.
4. Switch from H2 to MySQL (later).

---

## 📌 Summary

- We are shifting from a static in-memory list to a real database using JPA +
  Hibernate.
- The application is ready with required dependencies:
  `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` and `h2`.
- We'll begin by defining a `User` entity.

:::note

Enabling H2-Console In the next step, we use H2 as the database. Please add the
following setting to enable H2-Console:

/src/main/resources/application.properties

spring.h2.console.enabled=true
