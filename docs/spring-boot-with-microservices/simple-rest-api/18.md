# Introduction

In the next lecture, we will be automating the generation of API documentation
for our Spring Boot projects using **Springdoc OpenAPI**.

This library integrates well with Spring Boot and helps to generate and
visualize API documentation efficiently.

## **Dependency Setup**

To get started with **Springdoc OpenAPI** in your Spring Boot project, add the
following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
	<artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
	<version>2.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This dependency includes everything necessary to generate and visualize OpenAPI
documentation, including Swagger UI for a user-friendly interface.

### **Note:**

Make sure you use version `2.7.0` for `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui`.

In the next step, we will explore how to use this dependency and generate API
documentation for your Spring Boot REST API.
