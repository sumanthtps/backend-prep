title: Creating Post Entity and Mapping Relationship with User
sidebar_label: Post Entity Setup

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'; import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## 🎯 Goal

In this module, we:

- Create the `Post` JPA entity.
- Establish a **bidirectional relationship** with the `User` entity.
- Configure **lazy loading** and manage **infinite recursion** in JSON
  serialization.
- Insert seed data into the `post` table.
- Visualize table structure and data using H2 Console.
- Understand how Hibernate auto-generates schema and sequence tables.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. 🧱 Define the `Post` Entity

Create a `Post` class under the `user` package:

```java
@Entity
public class Post {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Integer id;

    private String description;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JsonIgnore
    private User user;

    // Generate Getters, Setters, and toString
}
```

> - `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)`: Prevents user data from being fetched
>   with every post.
> - `@JsonIgnore`: Avoids circular references when serializing.

---

### 2. 🔗 Update `User` Entity with Post Relationship

Add a list of posts to the `User` entity:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
@JsonIgnore
private List<Post> posts;
```

> - `mappedBy = "user"` points to the `Post.user` field.
> - Makes `User` the **inverse side** of the relationship.
> - `@JsonIgnore` prevents infinite loops during JSON conversion.

## 🧾 Table Structure Created by Hibernate

### user_details

| Column     | Type    | Notes       |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| id         | Integer | Primary Key |
| name       | String  |             |
| birth_date | Date    |             |

### post

| Column      | Type    | Notes                     |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| id          | Integer | Primary Key               |
| description | String  |                           |
| user_id     | Integer | Foreign Key to user table |

## 🛢️ Inserting Sample Data Using `data.sql`

Create the file `src/main/resources/data.sql`:

```sql
INSERT INTO POST (ID, DESCRIPTION, USER_ID) VALUES (20001, 'I want to learn AWS', 10001);
INSERT INTO POST (ID, DESCRIPTION, USER_ID) VALUES (20002, 'I want to learn DevOps', 10001);
INSERT INTO POST (ID, DESCRIPTION, USER_ID) VALUES (20003, 'Get AWS Certified', 10002);
INSERT INTO POST (ID, DESCRIPTION, USER_ID) VALUES (20004, 'Learn Multi-Cloud', 10002);
```

> ⚠️ SQL strings must use **single quotes (**\*\*****`'`**\*\*\*\***)\*\*, not
> double quotes (`"`).

---

## 🔍 Enable SQL Logging

Add to `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

> Displays SQL commands run by Hibernate — useful for debugging.

## 🔎 What Hibernate Does Behind the Scenes

Hibernate automatically:

- Creates `user_details` and `post` tables.
- Adds `user_id` as a **foreign key** in `post` because of `@ManyToOne`.
- Generates `user_details_seq` and `post_seq` for auto-generating `ID` fields.

---

## 💡 Advanced Topics

### 1. 🔁 Cascading Deletes

To delete all posts when a user is deleted:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JsonIgnore
private List<Post> posts;
```

### 2. 🔃 Alternative to `@JsonIgnore`: Use `@JsonManagedReference` and `@JsonBackReference`

This prevents infinite recursion and makes intent explicit:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Post> posts;

@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JsonBackReference
private User user;
```

### 3. 🛑 LazyInitializationException

`FetchType.LAZY` requires that the association be accessed **within an open
transaction**. Outside it, you'll get:

```text
LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session
```

✅ Solutions:

- Use `@Transactional` in service layer.
- Use DTOs instead of direct entity exposure in REST responses.

### 4. 📊 Join Queries and Performance

Eager fetching creates **cartesian joins** which can be expensive. Prefer lazy +
explicit joins if needed.

```java
@Query("SELECT p FROM Post p JOIN FETCH p.user WHERE p.id = :id")
Post findPostWithUser(@Param("id") Integer id);
```

## 🧠 Mini Quiz

1. What does `mappedBy` do in a `@OneToMany` relationship?
2. Why is `@JsonIgnore` important when using bidirectional mappings?
3. What's the difference between `FetchType.LAZY` and `EAGER`?
4. What causes `LazyInitializationException`?

### Answers
1) Specifies the field in the child entity that owns the relationship.
2) Prevents infinite recursion during JSON serialization.
3) LAZY delays loading related entities until accessed; EAGER loads them
   immediately.
4) Accessing a LAZY field outside an active Hibernate session.

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. Start the application.
2. Open: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
3. Use these SQL queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM USER_DETAILS;
   SELECT * FROM POST;
   ```
4. Confirm:
   - Posts are inserted.
   - Each post has a valid `user_id`.

## ✅ Next Steps

Now that we’ve modeled the Post entity and its relationship to User:

➡️ Let's build the REST API endpoints to:

- **GET** all posts for a user
- **POST** a new post for a user
