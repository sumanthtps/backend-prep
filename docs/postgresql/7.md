# Joins
Joins allow you to **combine data from multiple tables** based on a related column. PostgreSQL supports several types of joins:  

---

## **1️⃣ INNER JOIN (Common Data Only)**
Returns **only matching records** between two tables.  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT orders.id, users.name, orders.amount 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** Get **only users who have placed orders**.  

---

## **2️⃣ LEFT JOIN (All Left Table + Matching Right)**
Returns **all records from the left table**, and matching records from the right table.  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users 
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** Get **all users**, even if they haven’t placed orders.  

---

## **3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN (All Right Table + Matching Left)**
Returns **all records from the right table**, and matching records from the left table.  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users 
RIGHT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** Get **all orders**, even if some users don’t exist in the `users` table.  

---

## **4️⃣ FULL JOIN (All Records from Both Tables)**
Returns **all records from both tables**, inserting `NULL` where no match exists.  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users 
FULL JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** Get **all users and all orders**, even if no match exists.  

---

## **5️⃣ CROSS JOIN (Cartesian Product)**
Returns **every possible combination** of rows from both tables.  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT users.name, products.product_name 
FROM users 
CROSS JOIN products;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** **Pairing every user with every product** for recommendation models.  

---

## **6️⃣ SELF JOIN (Joining a Table to Itself)**
Used when a table has **hierarchical data** (e.g., employees reporting to managers).  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager 
FROM employees e1 
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```
🚀 **Use Case:** Get **employee-manager relationships**.  

---

### **⚡ Optimizing Joins**
✔ **Index foreign keys** for faster joins:  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```  
✔ **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`** to check performance.
