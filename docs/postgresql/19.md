# Advanced Query Optimization
Optimizing queries is essential for improving **performance, reducing execution time, and avoiding unnecessary resource usage**. PostgreSQL provides **query execution plans, indexing strategies, and optimizer techniques** to speed up queries.  

---

## **1️⃣ Understanding Query Execution Plans (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`)**  
✔ `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` **shows how PostgreSQL executes a query** and provides performance insights.  

✅ **Example Query Execution Plan:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

🚀 **Key Terms in Query Plans:**  
| Term                  | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Seq Scan (Sequential Scan)** | Scans the entire table (slow) |
| **Index Scan** | Uses an index (faster) |
| **Bitmap Index Scan** | Uses an index for large result sets (efficient) |
| **Nested Loop Join** | Efficient for small datasets |
| **Hash Join** | Faster for large datasets |
| **Sort** | Sorting data in memory |
| **Parallel Query Execution** | Uses multiple CPU cores |

---

## **2️⃣ Optimizing Index Usage**  
✔ **Indexing prevents slow sequential scans (`Seq Scan`)**.  
✔ **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to confirm index usage**.  

✅ **Step 1: Create an Index**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);
```

✅ **Step 2: Check Query Execution Plan**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
✔ **Expect `Index Scan` instead of `Seq Scan`!**  

---

## **3️⃣ Index-Only Scans (Fastest Query Execution)**  
✔ **If all columns in a query are covered by an index, PostgreSQL skips fetching rows from disk!**  

✅ **Create an Index with Covered Columns**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_amount ON orders(customer_id, amount);
```

✅ **Run a Query That Uses the Index-Only Scan**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT customer_id, amount FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
✔ **Query runs extremely fast using only the index!**  

---

## **4️⃣ Bitmap Index Scans (Optimizing Large Result Sets)**  
✔ **Used when querying large amounts of data where an index alone is inefficient.**  
✔ **PostgreSQL first fetches matching row locations from an index, then retrieves data in bulk.**  

✅ **Example Query That Uses a Bitmap Index Scan**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 1000;
```
✔ **If many rows match, PostgreSQL will switch from `Index Scan` to `Bitmap Index Scan` for efficiency.**  

---

## **5️⃣ Optimizing Joins (Nested Loop vs. Hash Join)**
✔ **Joins can slow down queries if not optimized.**  
✔ PostgreSQL chooses **Nested Loop, Hash Join, or Merge Join** based on table sizes.  

✅ **Check Query Plan for Join Performance**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users 
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
✔ **Expected Optimizations:**  
- **Use `Hash Join` for large datasets.**  
- **Use `Nested Loop Join` for small datasets.**  
- **Ensure indexes exist on `JOIN` keys.**  

✅ **Optimizing Joins with Indexes**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```
✔ **Speeds up queries involving `JOIN` on `orders.user_id`!**  

---

## **6️⃣ Parallel Query Execution (Faster Query Processing)**
✔ **PostgreSQL can execute queries using multiple CPU cores.**  
✔ **Enabled by default for queries that process large data.**  

✅ **Check Parallel Query Execution Settings**  
```sql
SHOW max_parallel_workers_per_gather;
```

✅ **Increase Parallel Query Execution for Faster Performance**  
```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
```
✔ **Best for `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN` operations.**  

---

## **7️⃣ Optimizer Hints & Cost-Based Optimization**
✔ PostgreSQL **automatically chooses the best query plan**, but we can influence it using cost-based optimization.  

✅ **Reduce Sequential Scans by Increasing Random Page Cost**  
```sql
SET random_page_cost = 1.1;
```
✔ **Encourages PostgreSQL to use indexes instead of sequential scans.**  

✅ **Force Parallel Execution on a Query**  
```sql
SET parallel_tuple_cost = 0.1;
SET parallel_setup_cost = 0.1;
```
✔ **Encourages PostgreSQL to use parallel queries!**

## **📝 Quiz - Query Optimization in PostgreSQL**
1️⃣ What does `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` do?  
2️⃣ How can you prevent a **Sequential Scan** (`Seq Scan`) in PostgreSQL?  
3️⃣ What is an **Index-Only Scan**, and how is it different from an **Index Scan**?  
4️⃣ When does PostgreSQL use a **Bitmap Index Scan**?  
5️⃣ How can you enable **parallel query execution**?  

Here are the correct answers:  

1️⃣ **What does `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` do?**  
✔ `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` runs a query and **shows the execution plan**, including:  
- **How PostgreSQL executes the query** (Index Scan, Seq Scan, etc.).  
- **Estimated vs. actual execution time**.  
- **Performance bottlenecks** (e.g., slow joins, large sequential scans).  

✅ **Example:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
🚀 **Use this to debug slow queries!**  

---

2️⃣ **How can you prevent a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`) in PostgreSQL?**  
✔ **Use an index on the column being filtered in `WHERE`**.  

✅ **Create an Index:**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);
```

✅ **Run Query & Check Execution Plan:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
✔ Expected result: **Index Scan instead of Seq Scan!**  

---

3️⃣ **What is an Index-Only Scan, and how is it different from an Index Scan?**  
✔ **Index-Only Scan**: PostgreSQL retrieves **all required data directly from the index** (faster).  
✔ **Index Scan**: PostgreSQL uses the index to find rows but **still needs to fetch data from disk**.  

✅ **Example of Index-Only Scan:**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_amount ON orders(customer_id, amount);
```
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT customer_id, amount FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
🚀 **Since both columns exist in the index, PostgreSQL skips disk access!**  

---

4️⃣ **When does PostgreSQL use a Bitmap Index Scan?**  
✔ **Used when querying a large number of rows where a regular index scan is inefficient**.  
✔ PostgreSQL first **fetches row locations from an index**, then **retrieves data in bulk**.  

✅ **Example Query That Triggers Bitmap Index Scan:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 1000;
```
✔ **If many rows match, PostgreSQL switches from Index Scan to Bitmap Index Scan for efficiency.**  

---

5️⃣ **How can you enable parallel query execution?**  
✔ PostgreSQL automatically enables parallel execution for large queries, but we can **increase parallelism** manually.  

✅ **Check Current Parallel Execution Setting:**  
```sql
SHOW max_parallel_workers_per_gather;
```

✅ **Increase Parallel Query Execution:**  
```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
```
🚀 **Now, PostgreSQL will distribute query processing across multiple CPU cores!**  

🔥 **Score: 5/5 if you got all correct!** 🎯
