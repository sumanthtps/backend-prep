# Missing Topics

---

## **1️⃣ WHERE Clause**  
✔ Filters rows **before aggregation**.  
✔ Works with **comparison operators (`=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`)**.  

✅ **Example: Get All Users Older Than 30**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

✅ **Example: Find Users Whose Name Starts With 'A'**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

✅ **Example: Find Orders Between Two Dates**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

---

## **2️⃣ LIMIT & OFFSET**  
✔ `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned.  
✔ `OFFSET` skips rows before returning results.  

✅ **Example: Get Top 5 Most Recent Orders**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 5;
```

✅ **Example: Skip First 10 Rows and Fetch Next 5**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

---

## **3️⃣ MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() - Aggregate Functions**  
| Function | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **MIN()** | Returns the smallest value | `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **MAX()** | Returns the largest value | `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;` |
| **COUNT()** | Counts number of rows | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;` |
| **SUM()** | Adds all values | `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders;` |
| **AVG()** | Finds the average value | `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;` |

✅ **Example: Find the Highest & Lowest Salaries**  
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary FROM employees;
```

✅ **Example: Count Active Users**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE is_active = true;
```

---

## **4️⃣ AS - Column & Table Aliases**  
✔ `AS` renames **columns or tables** in query results.  

✅ **Example: Rename a Column**  
```sql
SELECT name AS full_name, email AS contact_email FROM users;
```

✅ **Example: Rename a Table for a Query**  
```sql
SELECT u.name, o.amount FROM users AS u JOIN orders AS o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

---

## **5️⃣ UNION vs. UNION ALL**  
| Feature | `UNION` | `UNION ALL` |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Removes Duplicates?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Performance** | Slower | Faster |

✅ **Example: Combine Two Tables Without Duplicates**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM customers 
UNION 
SELECT name FROM suppliers;
```

✅ **Example: Combine Two Tables and Keep Duplicates**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM customers 
UNION ALL 
SELECT name FROM suppliers;
```

---

## **6️⃣ GROUP BY - Grouping & Aggregation**  
✔ **Groups data** by a column and applies **aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)**.  

✅ **Example: Total Sales Per Customer**  
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

✅ **Example: Count Employees Per Department**  
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

---

## **7️⃣ HAVING vs. WHERE**  
✔ `HAVING` filters after `GROUP BY`.  
✔ `WHERE` filters before `GROUP BY`.  

✅ **Example: Find Departments Where Avg Salary > 50000**  
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

✅ **Example: Find Active Users Older Than 30**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30 AND is_active = true;
```

---

## **8️⃣ EXISTS, ANY, and ALL**  
| Feature | `EXISTS` | `ANY` | `ALL` |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| **Returns** | `TRUE` if **subquery returns any rows** | `TRUE` if **any value** in subquery matches | `TRUE` if **all values** in subquery match |
| **Used With** | Subqueries | Comparison operators (`=, >, <`) | Comparison operators |

✅ **Example (`EXISTS`) - Find Users Who Have Orders**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM users 
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.user_id = users.id);
```

✅ **Example (`ANY`) - Find Employees Who Earn More Than Any HR Employee**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees 
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
```

✅ **Example (`ALL`) - Find Employees Who Earn More Than Everyone in HR**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees 
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
```

---

## **9️⃣ CASE - Conditional Logic in SQL**  
✔ Works like **IF-ELSE** for SQL queries.  

✅ **Example: Assign Salary Ranges**  
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
        ELSE 'Low Salary'
    END AS salary_range
FROM employees;
```

✅ **Example: Assign Order Status Labels**  
```sql
SELECT order_id, status, 
    CASE status 
        WHEN 'P' THEN 'Pending'
        WHEN 'S' THEN 'Shipped'
        WHEN 'D' THEN 'Delivered'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS status_label
FROM orders;
```

## **🔟 Final Summary of Missing Topics**
| Topic | Explanation | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **WHERE** | Filters rows before aggregation | `WHERE age > 30` |
| **LIMIT & OFFSET** | Restricts and skips rows | `LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10` |
| **MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM, AVG** | Aggregate functions | `AVG(salary)` |
| **AS** | Renames columns/tables | `name AS full_name` |
| **UNION vs. UNION ALL** | Combines queries | `UNION` removes duplicates |
| **GROUP BY** | Groups data for aggregation | `GROUP BY department` |
| **HAVING vs. WHERE** | `HAVING` filters after `GROUP BY` | `HAVING COUNT(*) > 10` |
| **EXISTS, ANY, ALL** | Subquery filtering | `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders)` |
| **CASE** | Conditional logic in SQL | `CASE WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'High'` |
