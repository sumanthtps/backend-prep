# Advanced JSON & JSONB
PostgreSQL provides **powerful support for JSON and JSONB** data types, making it ideal for **semi-structured data storage and retrieval**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Difference Between `JSON` and `JSONB`**
| Feature    | `JSON` | `JSONB` |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Storage Type | Text-based (raw JSON) | Binary format |
| Read Performance | Slow (needs re-parsing) | Fast (pre-parsed, indexed) |
| Indexing | ❌ No Index Support | ✅ Supports GIN/BTREE indexes |
| Modification | ❌ Cannot modify fields efficiently | ✅ Supports partial updates |

🚀 **Best Practice:** ✅ **Always use `JSONB`** unless you need to store raw JSON for exact formatting.  

✅ **Example (Storing JSON Data in a Table)**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    details JSONB -- Stores flexible user data
);
```

✅ **Inserting JSONB Data**  
```sql
INSERT INTO users (details) 
VALUES ('{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "skills": ["SQL", "PostgreSQL"]}');
```

---

## **2️⃣ Querying JSONB Data**
### **Extracting Fields**
✅ **Get a JSON field (`->`)**  
```sql
SELECT details->'name' FROM users;
```
✔ Returns: `"Alice"` (as JSON)  

✅ **Get a JSON field as text (`->>`)**  
```sql
SELECT details->>'name' FROM users;
```
✔ Returns: `Alice` (as TEXT)  

✅ **Query Nested JSON Fields (`#>` and `#>>`)**  
```sql
SELECT details#>'{skills, 0}' FROM users;
```
✔ Returns: `"SQL"` (Accesses first skill in the array)  

---

## **3️⃣ Searching Inside JSONB**
✅ **Check if JSON contains a value (`@>`)**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE details @> '{"age": 25}';
```
✔ Finds **users with age = 25**  

✅ **Search for a key (`?`)**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE details ? 'skills';
```
✔ Finds **users who have a "skills" key in their JSON**  

✅ **Search for a value inside an array (`?|` and `?&`)**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE details->'skills' ?| ARRAY['SQL', 'Java'];
```
✔ Finds users with **either "SQL" or "Java"** in `skills`  

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE details->'skills' ?& ARRAY['SQL', 'Java'];
```
✔ Finds users with **both "SQL" and "Java"**  

---

## **4️⃣ Updating JSONB Data**
✅ **Adding a New Field (`jsonb_set`)**  
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET details = jsonb_set(details, '{city}', '"New York"');
```
✔ Adds `"city": "New York"` to JSON  

✅ **Updating a Nested Value**  
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET details = jsonb_set(details, '{age}', '30');
```
✔ Updates `"age"` field to `30`  

✅ **Removing a Field (`-` Operator)**  
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET details = details - 'age';
```
✔ Removes `"age"` field from JSON  

---

## **5️⃣ Indexing JSONB for Performance**
Since `JSONB` allows indexing, we can speed up queries significantly.  

✅ **Create a GIN Index for Faster Searches**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_details ON users USING GIN (details);
```
✔ Boosts performance for queries like:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE details @> '{"age": 25}';
```

✅ **Create a BTREE Index for a Specific JSON Field**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_age ON users ((details->>'age'));
```
✔ Speeds up queries filtering by `"age"`  

---

## **6️⃣ Best Practices for JSONB**
✔ **Use `JSONB` instead of `JSON`** for indexing and performance.  
✔ **Avoid deep nesting**—harder to query and index.  
✔ **Create indexes** for frequently queried keys.  
✔ **Use `jsonb_set()` for updates instead of rewriting entire JSON objects.**  
✔ **For relational data, use regular columns instead of JSON!**
