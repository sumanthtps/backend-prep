# Introduction
#### **1. What is PostgreSQL?**  
PostgreSQL (often called **Postgres**) is an **open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS)**. It is known for:  
- **Reliability** ‚Äì ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì Supports custom functions, data types, operators, and procedural languages.  
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Handles large datasets and supports replication, partitioning, and high concurrency.  
- **Advanced Features** ‚Äì JSONB (binary JSON), full-text search, window functions, and geospatial data support (PostGIS).  

#### **2. Key Features of PostgreSQL**  
| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| ACID Compliance       | Ensures reliability of transactions. |
| MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) | Allows concurrent transactions without locks. |
| JSON/JSONB Support    | Stores and queries JSON data efficiently. |
| Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) | Connects to other databases like MySQL, MongoDB. |
| Table Partitioning    | Improves performance for large datasets. |
| Full-Text Search      | Enables searching large text-based data. |
| Streaming Replication | Supports high availability. |
| Procedural Languages  | Supports PL/pgSQL, Python, JavaScript. |

#### **3. PostgreSQL Architecture Overview**  
PostgreSQL consists of multiple components:  
- **Postmaster (Main Process):** Manages client connections, background processes.  
- **Shared Buffers:** Stores frequently accessed data for performance.  
- **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging):** Ensures durability and crash recovery.  
- **Background Writer:** Flushes dirty pages to disk.  
- **Autovacuum:** Cleans up dead tuples to optimize performance.
