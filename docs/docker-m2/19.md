title: Building Your First Docker Image
sidebar_position: 46
---------------------

## Introduction

Now that you’ve written your first `Dockerfile`, it’s time to **build an image** from it and understand how Docker processes that file.

In this section, we’ll walk through:

* How to build your image using `docker image build`
* What the **build context** is
* Common mistakes and how to avoid them
* How to verify your image was created successfully
* Why the image ID may match the base image ID
* A quick intro to image listing and inspection

---

## Step 1: Prepare the Build Context

The **build context** is the directory you give Docker to look for:

- The `Dockerfile`
- Any files referenced in the Dockerfile (e.g., via `COPY`, `ADD`)

> ✅ Tip: The context should contain **only** what’s needed to build your image
> to avoid performance issues.

### Example

If your `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, and you want to include that
context:

```bash
docker image build .
```

The `.` means "current directory."

---

## Step 2: Run the Build Command

Basic syntax:

```bash
docker image build [OPTIONS] PATH
```

- `PATH`: path to the build context (e.g., `.`, `./my-app`, etc.)
- `-t`: (optional) tag the image with a custom name

### Example:

```bash
docker image build -t my-first-image .
```

> This will use the `Dockerfile` inside the current folder to build the image
> and name it `my-first-image`.

---

## Step 3: Understand the Output

If you only have this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
```

Then:

- Docker downloads (or uses cached) `ubuntu` image
- No new layer is added (because no further instructions)
- Your image gets the same ID as the base image

### Why?

The `FROM` instruction itself **does not create a new layer** unless additional
instructions are layered on top (like `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.).

---

## Step 4: Verify the Image Was Built

Use the following command:

```bash
docker image ls
```

> ⚠️ Common Mistake: Don't run `docker images ls` – that’s **invalid**. The
> correct command is:
>
> ```bash
> docker image ls
> ```

You’ll see something like:

```
REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
my-first-image    latest    58dbd8ed...    10 seconds ago   77MB
ubuntu            latest    58dbd8ed...    1 week ago       77MB
```

> Note: Both `my-first-image` and `ubuntu` may share the same image ID if your
> Dockerfile doesn’t add anything new.

---

## Optional: Assign a Name and Tag

Use the `-t` flag to name and tag your image during the build:

```bash
docker image build -t my-first-image:1.0 .
```

Now you can reference the image as `my-first-image:1.0`.

---

## What Is Build Context?

When you build an image, Docker **sends the entire folder** (build context) to
the Docker daemon. This context:

- Is used by `COPY` or `ADD` instructions in your Dockerfile
- Should **exclude** unnecessary files using `.dockerignore`

### Why is Context Important?

Imagine running this:

```bash
docker image build /home/sumanth
```

Docker will recursively send **everything** inside `/home/sumanth` to the daemon
— including large videos, backups, etc. This will **slow down your builds** or
even cause failures.

## Summary

| Command                | Purpose                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `docker image build .` | Build image using current directory        |
| `-t name:tag`          | Assign name and tag to image               |
| `docker image ls`      | List all local images                      |
| `docker images`        | Alias for `docker image ls` (legacy usage) |

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Why did my image have the same ID as `ubuntu`?

**A:** Because you only had `FROM ubuntu` and didn’t add any new layers. Docker
reused the base image directly.

---

### Q2: What is the "context" in Docker builds?

**A:** The directory sent to Docker daemon during image build. It must include
the `Dockerfile` and any files to be copied into the image.

---

### Q3: What does this command do?

```bash
docker image build -t my-image .
```

**A:** Builds an image named `my-image` from the `Dockerfile` in the current
directory.

---

### Q4: Why does Docker recommend using BuildKit or Buildx?

**A:** BuildKit offers performance improvements, caching, and better
multi-platform support. But classic `docker build` still works the same way and
is fine for local use.

---

### Q5: How can I avoid large build contexts?

**A:** Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like:

```dockerignore
node_modules
*.log
.git
.vscode
```
