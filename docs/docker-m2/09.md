sidebar_position: 35
---------------------

## Question 1 of 13

**Which of these statements best describes how Windows Subsystem for Linux works?**

* WSL enables running Linux inside Windows by automatically setting up a dual-boot configuration.
* WSL enables running Docker inside Windows by automatically setting up a dual-boot configuration.
* WSL enables running Docker inside Windows through a lightweight virtual machine.
* **✅ WSL enables running Linux inside Windows through a lightweight virtual machine.**

**Explanation:**
WSL translates Linux syscalls into Windows equivalents using a lightweight VM (WSL2 runs a real Linux kernel).

## Question 2 of 13

**There are two ways of configuring Docker to use another Docker Engine UNIX
socket: \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_.**

- SSH, remotely copying the socket onto your machine with `limactl copy`
- SSH, the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable
- **✅ contexts, the DOCKER_HOST environment variable**
- contexts, SSH

**Explanation:** Docker can be pointed to a different engine via
`docker context` or the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

- **✅ limactl start --name=foo /tmp/config.yml**
- limactl create --name=foo /tmp/config.yml
- lima create --name=foo /tmp/config.yml
- lima start --name=foo /tmp/config.yml

**Explanation:** `limactl start` initializes and starts a Lima VM using a

## Question 6 of 13

**Which command installs Docker on a Linux system provisioned by Lima?**

- **✅ curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) | sh**
- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` … custom script
- `./scripts/install_docker.sh`

**Explanation:** `get.docker.com` provides the official Docker convenience
script for any Linux distribution.

## Question 7 of 13

**Which feature does Portainer best substitute from Docker Desktop?**

- installing Docker
- signing up for Azure Container Service
- creating networks of containers through Docker Compose
- **✅ interacting with containers through a graphical user interface**

**Explanation:** Portainer provides a GUI similar to Docker Desktop’s container
management dashboard.

## Question 8 of 13

**A colleague sees `bash: lima: command not found` on Apple Silicon when running
`lima --help`. What’s the solution?**

- Lima does not support Apple Silicon at this time.
- They forgot to tell Lima. Download and compile from source.
- **✅ They forgot to install Lima. Tell them to install Homebrew and run
  `brew install lima`.**

**Explanation:** The error shows Lima is not installed. Installing via Homebrew
fixes it.

## Question 9 of 13

**Which command will download and install Docker automatically?**

- sudo curl get.docker.io bash
- curl -L [https://get.docker.io](https://get.docker.io)
- sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
- **✅ curl -L [https://get.docker.io](https://get.docker.io) | bash**

**Explanation:** The official installer uses `curl ... | bash` to bootstrap
Docker Engine.

- docker start
- service docker start
- **✅ sudo service docker start**

**Explanation:** The `sudo service docker start` command launches the Docker
daemon inside Ubuntu.

---

## Question 11 of 13

**Correct order for installing Ubuntu inside WSL:**

- **✅ wsl --update → wsl --shutdown → wsl --install -d ubuntu**
- wsl --install -d ubuntu → wsl --shutdown → wsl --update
- wsl --shutdown → wsl --update → wsl --install -d ubuntu

**Explanation:** Update WSL, shut it down cleanly, then install the
distribution.

---

## Question 12 of 13

**Which tool does Lima use to create and run VMs?**

- **✅ QEMU**
- Docker
- VirtualBox
- VMware Fusion

**Explanation:** Lima leverages QEMU to run lightweight Linux VMs on macOS.

---

## Question 13 of 13

**Which situation most accurately requires an alternative to Docker Desktop?**

- Your team needs to run the Docker Engine on a virtual machine.
- **✅ Your team needs to run the Docker engine on virtual machines with a
  FIPS-compliant operating system configuration.**
- You want to use the crun runtime instead of containerd.
- You want a graphical user interface for managing Docker containers.

**Explanation:** Docker Desktop's managed VM may not meet strict compliance
needs; a manual Docker install on a hardened VM may be required.
