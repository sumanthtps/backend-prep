title: Visualizing Containers with Portainer
sidebar_position: 34
---------------------

## Introduction

Docker Desktop provides a built-in UI to manage containers, but in environments where Docker Desktop isn't used or available, you can still have a graphical interface using **Portainer**. Portainer is a lightweight, open-source web UI that acts as a **front-end for the Docker API**.

---

## What is Portainer?

- A **Docker management UI**.
- Allows almost all Docker CLI operations through a browser.
- Runs **as a container** itself.
- Open-source:
  [github.com/portainer/portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer).

---

## Installing Portainer

Portainer installation is just running a container with the proper volumes and
ports mapped.

### Command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -p 9443:9443 \
  --name portainer \
  --restart always \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data \
  portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

### Explanation of Flags:

- `-d` → Run in detached mode.
- `-p` → Publish ports:

  - `8000` (agent communication)
  - `9443` (web UI via HTTPS)

- `--restart always` → Automatically restart Portainer on host reboot.
- `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` → Gives Portainer access to the
  Docker Engine.
- `-v portainer_data:/data` → Persistent storage for UI and config.

---

## Accessing Portainer

1. Open browser: `https://localhost:9443`
2. Accept self-signed certificate warning.
3. Create the admin user (password must be 12+ characters).
4. Select the local Docker environment.

---

## Creating a Container via Portainer

1. Click **Add container**.
2. Set the name (e.g., `nginx`).
3. Use the official NGINX image:

   ```
   nginx
   ```

4. Configure port binding:

   - Host port: `8080`
   - Container port: `80`

5. Click **Deploy the container**.

### Test in Browser:

Visit: `http://localhost:8080`

You should see the NGINX welcome page, confirming the container is running.

---

## Removing a Container via Portainer

1. Go to **Containers** view.
2. Select the `nginx` container.
3. Click **Remove**.
4. Toggle "Remove non-persistent volumes".
5. Confirm deletion.

## Benefits of Portainer

- Easy visual management of containers, images, volumes, and networks.
- Quick deployment and cleanup.
- Good for beginners to understand container lifecycle visually.
- Runs anywhere Docker runs.

**A:** Portainer uses HTTPS with a self-signed certificate by default. You can
configure it with trusted certificates for production.

---

### Q4: Can Portainer manage remote Docker hosts?

**A:** Yes. You can add remote environments and Docker Swarm clusters to the
Portainer UI.

---

### Q5: Does Portainer work with Kubernetes?

**A:** Yes. Portainer has a Kubernetes edition that integrates with K8s
clusters.
