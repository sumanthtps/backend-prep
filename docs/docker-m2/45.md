## Summary

Container networking enables isolated applications inside containers to
communicate with each other and the outside world. Docker provides a flexible,
pluggable networking system that supports multiple technologies such as virtual
interfaces, overlays, and custom drivers. This section introduces you to the
foundational ideas behind how containerized networking differs from host
networking, and what it means for packet delivery and routing.

## Key Concepts

### 🧠 Real-World Networking Recap

A traditional network session involves:

1. A request from a client to a server.
2. The server responds with packets.
3. These packets move through **routers**, **gateway devices**, and eventually
   to your machine.
4. Your **Network Interface Card (NIC)** receives them.
5. Your **Operating System (OS)** processes them.
6. The relevant application (e.g., browser) consumes the data.

### 🔁 Container Perspective

The process is similar up to the NIC, but diverges afterward:

- The **OS inspects the packets** and **routes** them **to Docker**, not
  directly to applications.
- Docker handles **routing inside containers** using **network plugins** and
  **virtual interfaces**.

### 🧩 Networking Plug-ins in Docker

Docker's networking is **modular**. Networking behavior is managed by
**plug-ins** which dictate:

| Plugin Type | Behavior                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **bridge**  | Connects containers on a single host via a virtual switch. Default in Docker.                    |
| **host**    | Removes container network isolation; container shares host's network stack.                      |
| **none**    | Disables networking; container is isolated.                                                      |
| **macvlan** | Gives container its own MAC address. Useful for direct connection to physical networks.          |
| **overlay** | Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts. Used in Swarm/Kubernetes. |

See:
[Docker Networking Plugins documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/plugins/)

### 📶 Virtual vs Real NICs

Some plug-ins simulate network interfaces (veth pairs), while others (e.g.,
macvlan) assign **real IP/MAC identities** to containers on the host network.

### 📦 Networking with Docker

```plaintext
[Internet] → [Router] → [Host NIC] → [OS] → [Docker Engine] → [Container Network Plugin] → [Container App]
```

```

- Docker intercepts traffic **after** the OS layer.
- Docker plugins determine **how to route** packets internally.

---

## Upcoming Topics in This Chapter

- Creating containers with **specific network plug-ins** (e.g.,
  `--network bridge`, `--network host`)
- How **Docker port mappings** (`-p`) work to expose services
- Deep dive into **overlay networks** used by orchestrators
- Using containers to **host services** (web servers, DBs, etc.) with external
  access

---

## INFO PANEL

Docker defaults to the **bridge network driver**, which gives each container its
own internal IP and a NAT connection to the host. This works well for most
single-host deployments.

For production-scale networking across hosts, **overlay** and **macvlan**
drivers are more common.

## Questions You Should Be Able to Answer

1. How does Docker intercept and route network traffic meant for containers?
2. What are the trade-offs between using the `host` vs `bridge` network driver?
3. Why would a container need a "real" MAC address via `macvlan`?
4. How do orchestrators like Kubernetes leverage overlay networks?
