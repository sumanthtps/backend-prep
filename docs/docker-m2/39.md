## Quiz Questions, Correct Answers, and Detailed Explanations

---

### ‚úÖ Question 1

**Q:** By default, logging drivers are **\_** unless the **\_** option is used.

**Options:**

- A. blocking, --non-blocking
- B. nonblocking, --blocking
- C. nonblocking, --log-opts mode=blocking
- D. **blocking, --log-opts mode=non-blocking** ‚úÖ

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

- Docker logging drivers **block** container output by default until the logs
  are handled.
- The `--log-opts mode=non-blocking` flag allows logs to be processed
  asynchronously, reducing performance impact at the cost of potential data
  loss.

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A:** `--non-blocking` is not a valid Docker CLI flag.
- **B:** Incorrect default assumption.
- **C:** Incorrect log-opts usage; `mode=blocking` is not a supported option.

### ‚úÖ Question 2

**Q:** You have a container that was created with `--mem 1G`. Which of these
statements is **false**?

**Options:**

- A. The application will receive up to 1G of the system's memory and will get
  killed by the operating system when exceeded.
- B. The application will receive up to 1G of the system's memory and will get
  paused if `--disable-oom-kill` is provided to docker run. ‚ùå
- C. **The application will receive up to 1G of the system's memory. It will
  continue to run, though you might experience unpredictable behavior.** ‚úÖ
- D. The application might terminate unexpectedly if it exceeds the 1G limit.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

- When a container exceeds its memory limit, **the kernel immediately kills it**
  (`SIGKILL`).
- Option C is **false** because the container will not continue running.

**Why Others Are Correct:**

- **A, D:** Accurately describe the container being terminated.
- **B:** Valid when `--oom-kill-disable` is supported (though rarely used in
  production).

### ‚úÖ Question 3

**Q:** Consider this snippet:  
`docker run --rm --cpus 0.5 my-image`  
Assuming `--cpu-period` is 1,000,000, which `--cpu-quota` matches the `--cpus`
setting?

**Options:**

- A. --cpu-quota 0.5
- B. --cpu-quota 100000
- C. --cpu-quota 2.0
- D. **--cpu-quota 500000** ‚úÖ

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

- `--cpus 0.5` means 50% CPU time.
- CPU quota = CPU period √ó fraction of CPU = 1,000,000 √ó 0.5 = **500,000**

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A, C:** Invalid units (microseconds expected, not fractional or decimal).
- **B:** Represents only 0.1 CPUs (10%), not 0.5.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 4

**Q:** You see in logs: `ERROR: Killed, signal 9`. What is the most likely
cause?

**Options:**

- A. The application has a bug in its error-handling logic.
- B. The container has a processor limit set, and the application within it
  attempted to exceed it.
- C. **The container has a memory limit set, and the application within it
  attempted to exceed it.** ‚úÖ
- D. Congratulations! You found a bug in Docker!

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

- Signal `9` = `SIGKILL` = kernel forcefully killed the process, usually due to
  **Out of Memory (OOM)**.
- Docker enforces memory limits using cgroups; exceeding limit ‚Üí process gets
  killed.

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A:** Would not result in signal 9.
- **B:** CPU overuse doesn't terminate apps; they're throttled.
- **D:** Misleading humor ‚Äî not a Docker bug.

### ‚úÖ Question 5

**Q:** You must run a container with only these capabilities:

- `CAP_LEASE`
- `CAP_MKNOD`
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN`

Which `docker run` command satisfies this **most securely**?

**Options:**

- A. docker run --privileged my-app
- B. docker run --cap-drop $X my-image...
- C. **docker run --cap-add CAP_LEASE --cap-add CAP_MKNOD --cap-add
  CAP_NET_ADMIN --cap-drop ALL --rm my-app** ‚úÖ
- D. docker run --cap-add CAP_LEASE --cap-add CAP_MKNOD --cap-add CAP_NET_ADMIN
  my-app

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

- `--cap-drop ALL` drops all Linux capabilities first.
- Only required capabilities are added back, making this **principle of least
  privilege** in action.

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A:** `--privileged` grants **all** capabilities (overkill and unsafe).
- **B:** `$X` is abstract and error-prone.
- **D:** Adds capabilities but does **not drop** unnecessary ones ‚Äî still risky.

### ‚úÖ Question 6

**Q:** You're running a VPN container using:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 --name vpn my-vpn-application --forward
```

```

It fails to start. What‚Äôs the most likely reason?

**Options:**

- A. You forgot to provide the version tag for my-vpn-application.
- B. **This container does not have enough Linux capabilities added to it to
  create the VPN networking device.** ‚úÖ
- C. You forgot to provide `--net=host` to docker run.
- D. Docker is unable to create network devices due to technical limitations.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- VPNs often require advanced privileges like `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to create tunnel
  devices (e.g., `/dev/net/tun`).

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A:** Missing version tag won't prevent container from starting.
- **C:** `--net=host` is not required for creating VPN tunnels.
- **D:** Docker supports network device creation **if correct capabilities are
  granted**.

### ‚úÖ Question 7

**Q:** Which of these **does NOT** explain why `--privileged` should be used
cautiously?

**Options:**

- A. **It allows you to override your container's application default user.** ‚úÖ
- B. It allows your container the ability to modify its host system.
- C. It can allow your container to have access to sensitive host devices.
- D. It enables all privileges for a container for whom `--privileged` is
  granted.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

- Changing user is **not** the reason why `--privileged` is dangerous ‚Äî it can
  be done using `--user` or `USER` in Dockerfile.

**Why Others Are Correct:**

- **B, C, D:** All describe risks of using `--privileged`.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 8

**Q:** What happens when you run:
`docker run --name container --log-driver=none my-image`

**Options:**

- A. Logs are visible via docker logs and stored as `${container_id}-json.log`.
- B. Logs visible from app, but not docker logs. JSON log still exists.
- C. Logs visible via docker logs, but no JSON file in container log dir.
- D. **Logs visible in the app, but not from docker logs, and no log file exists
  in `/var/lib/docker/...`.** ‚úÖ

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

- `--log-driver=none` disables logging entirely:

  - No output in `docker logs`
  - No log file in container directories

**Why Others Are Incorrect:**

- **A, B, C:** All assume some logging is captured. But `none` means **no
  logging**.

---

## üß† Final Thoughts

- Use **capabilities** and `--privileged` flags carefully.
- Use `--log-driver` and `--log-opts` to integrate with external logging tools.
- Set **CPU and memory limits** to prevent runaway containers.
- Avoid `--privileged` unless absolutely necessary ‚Äî use granular capabilities
  instead.
