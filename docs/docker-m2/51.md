## ✅ Question 1: Purpose of bridge networks

**Correct Answer:**

> Bridge networks link multiple networks across multiple namespaces together to
> allow containers to communicate with each other.

- **Why correct:** A bridge network is the default driver in Docker (`docker0`
  bridge). It creates a virtual subnet so containers can talk to each other as
  if they’re on the same LAN, isolated from the host’s network.
- **Why others are wrong:**

  - _“Use RIPv2”_ → false, Docker uses Linux kernel bridging + iptables NAT, not
    routing protocols.
  - _“Join multiple vNICs into one interface”_ → that’s more like
    bonding/teaming in Linux, not Docker bridge.

## ❌ Question 2: Which is **not correct** about bridge networks

**Correct Answer:**

> Bridge networks use a virtual network device to collapse multiple networks
> together into one.

- **Why correct (this is the wrong statement):** A bridge doesn’t “collapse
  multiple networks into one.” Instead, it creates a **new isolated virtual
  subnet** for containers.
- **Why you missed it:** The tricky wording — it sounds close to “bridge” in
  real networking, but Docker’s bridge is more like a **private virtual
  switch**.
- **Why others are correct:**

  - Containers _can_ talk across bridge networks if attached with the driver.
  - On a **default bridge**, you need IPs to talk; on a **custom bridge**,
    containers get DNS names.
  - Yes, containers on different bridges cannot talk by default.

👉 **Key trick:** Default bridge = no DNS names, custom bridge = DNS names.

## ✅ Question 3: Difference between macvlan and ipvlan

**Correct Answer:**

> ipvlan attempts to avoid IP address conflicts, whereas macvlan does not.

- **Why correct:** ipvlan has different modes (L2 and L3) and can reduce
  broadcast traffic + simplify IP usage.
- **Why others are wrong:**

  - _“ipvlan has L2 & L3, macvlan single mode”_ → true difference.
  - _“ipvlan gives all containers same MAC”_ → true, macvlan gives each
    container a unique MAC.
  - _“Interchangeable”_ → false, different use cases.

## ✅ Question 4: The \_\_\_ driver disables \_\_\_ networking

**Correct Answer:**

> none, all, null

- **Why correct:** The `none` driver disables all networking. Containers get
  loopback only, no external connectivity.
- **Why others are wrong:** `null` isn’t a driver in Docker networking.

---

## ✅ Question 5: True about bridge networks

**Correct Answer:**

> They provide isolation through network namespace unsharing and iptables rules.

- **Why correct:** Docker bridge relies on Linux namespaces (each container has
  its own stack) + iptables NAT rules for outbound traffic.
- **Why others are wrong:**

  - Containers _do_ get dedicated IPs inside the subnet.
  - They _do_ get virtual adapters (veth pairs).
  - They do **not** share the host stack unless in host networking mode.

## ✅ Question 6: Game server + dynamic UDP ports

**Correct Answer:**

> Use host mode networking.

- **Why correct:** Host networking removes NAT/port-mapping overhead and allows
  the container to bind directly to the host’s ports. Perfect for dynamic UDP
  port ranges.
- **Why others are wrong:**

  - Bridge mode would require explicit port mappings (impractical for 5000+
    dynamic ports).
  - Running game clients in Docker too is not realistic unless you control the
    whole ecosystem.

# 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Default bridge vs custom bridge** → know the DNS behavior difference.
- **Bridge ≠ “collapse”** → it’s a private subnet, not merging networks.
- **macvlan vs ipvlan** → macvlan = unique MAC per container, ipvlan = one MAC,
  multiple IPs.
- **none network** → only loopback works.
- **host networking** → useful for high-performance or dynamic port apps.
