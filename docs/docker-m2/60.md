### **Question 1 of 7**

> Your manager has asked you to choose a container registry. Your business is in
> the insurance industry and must meet several industry regulations. While your
> team is eager to move to the cloud, most of your applications run out of your
> private data centers. Which of these options would most likely satisfy these
> requirements?

**Options:**

- a cloud-based container registry, like Azure Container Registry
- a cloud-based container registry in all major clouds
- **✅ an enterprise registry, like VMware Harbor or Quay**
- a source code registry, like GitHub Container Registry

**Correct Answer:** ✅ an enterprise registry, like VMware Harbor or Quay

**Explanation:** Enterprise registries are designed to meet strict compliance
and regulatory requirements and can be hosted in private data centers. They
support on-premise deployment, advanced security, access control, and
integration with enterprise IAM systems — all crucial for industries like
insurance. Cloud-based registries and GitHub Container Registry may not offer
the same level of compliance guarantees.

### **Question 2 of 7**

> Which of these reasons is NOT a typical reason why teams use alternate
> container registries (i.e. not Docker Hub)?

**Options:**

- For improved integration into source code build and release pipelines
- For better compatibility with atypical operating environments
- **✅ To test image pulls and pushes locally**
- For increased security and privacy

**Correct Answer:** ✅ To test image pulls and pushes locally

**Explanation:** Testing locally is not a strong driver for switching away from
Docker Hub. In contrast, integration into CI/CD, avoiding Docker Hub pull
limits, and improving security are very common reasons for using alternate
registries like GitHub, GitLab, AWS ECR, etc.

### **Question 3 of 7**

> In this video, `docker ps` was used to check that the registry container was
> running. Assuming no other containers exist on the system, what would you
> expect to see if the registry container was created but is not running?

**Options:**

- **✅ nothing**
- that the registry container is in a Stopped state
- that the registry container in a NotRunning state.

**Correct Answer:** ✅ nothing

**Explanation:** `docker ps` only shows _running_ containers by default. If the
container was stopped or failed to start, it would not appear in the output
unless you use `docker ps -a`.

### **Question 4 of 7**

> You wish to push the nginx image on your computer to an authenticated image
> registry at `registry.example.com`. The host behind `registry.example.com` has
> several other services running on it. The image registry is hosted on
> port 9999. Which of these options correctly specifies the commands required to
> perform this task?

**Options:**

- **✅**

  ```bash
  docker login registry.example.com:9999
  docker tag nginx registry.example.com:9999/nginx
  docker push registry.example.com:9999/nginx
  ```

- docker login registry.example.com:9999 docker tag nginx
  registry.example.com/nginx docker pushregistry.example.com:9999/nginxx
- docker tag nginx registry.example.com/nginx docker
  pushregistry.example.com:9999/nginxx
- docker tag nginx registry.example.com:9999/nginx docker push
  registry.example.com:9999/nginx

**Correct Answer:** ✅ First option (all three commands with correct format and
port)

**Explanation:** To push to a non-standard port (9999), both the login and tag
must include the full domain and port. Docker needs the full path like
`registry.example.com:9999/repo-name`.

### **Question 5 of 7**

> Which of these problems does putting a reverse proxy in front of your local
> Docker registry solve?

**Options:**

- adds support for multi-platform manifest lists
- speeds up image pulls and pushes
- **✅ provides support for registry authentication**
- allows the registry to be accessed from curl or a web browser.

**Correct Answer:** ✅ provides support for registry authentication

**Explanation:** Adding a reverse proxy (like NGINX) allows you to add **basic
authentication** (via `htpasswd`) and **TLS encryption** for HTTPS access —
which is not natively supported by the `registry:2` container alone. It does
**not** directly affect pull speeds or manifest support (in fact, manifests can
break in local HTTPS setups).

### **Question 6 of 7**

> You are creating a local registry to test a container image automation script.
> Attempting to log into the registry with docker login yields the following
> error: `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. Which of these options
> is the most likely root cause of the problem?

**Options:**

- SSL on the host running your Docker Engine is misconfigured.
- SSL on the reverse proxy in front of your registry is misconfigured.
- **✅ The host your Docker Engine is running on is missing your registry's
  certificate authority certificate.**

**Correct Answer:** ✅ The host your Docker Engine is running on is missing your
registry's certificate authority certificate.

**Explanation:** This is a classic error when using self-signed certificates.
Docker does not trust the cert unless the corresponding CA certificate is added
to the host's trusted cert list (`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` and then
`update-ca-certificates`).

### **Question 7 of 7**

> Your team wants to move container images for their open-source app out of
> Docker Hub. Their testing pipelines pull container images several hundred
> times per hour and are frequently blocked on Docker Hub's rate limits. They
> desire a registry that integrates well into their pipelines with minimal
> scripts. While their images are pulled from computing hosted on all major
> cloud providers, they themselves do not maintain much of a presence in any
> cloud. Additionally, while the project receives funding from big
> organizations, minimizing cost is their priority. Which of these options would
> most likely satisfy these requirements?

**Options:**

- **✅ a source code registry, like GitHub Container Registry**
- an enterprise registry, like VMware Harbor or Quay
- a cloud-based container registry, like Azure Container Registry

**Correct Answer:** ✅ a source code registry, like GitHub Container Registry

**Explanation:** Source code registries like GitHub’s are **free or cheap**,
integrate **seamlessly with CI/CD**, and avoid **pull rate limits**. Since the
team doesn't host on the cloud much and wants low cost + simple setup, GitHub’s
registry fits best.
